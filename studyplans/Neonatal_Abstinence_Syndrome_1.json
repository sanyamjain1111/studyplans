            "concept": "Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a withdrawal condition seen in newborns, primarily resulting from in utero exposure to opioids, though other substances like benzodiazepines can also contribute. The pathophysiology of NAS involves central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic overactivity, and gastrointestinal disturbances, reflecting the abrupt cessation of substance exposure after birth. Clinically, NAS manifests with a spectrum of symptoms, including tremors, jitteriness, irritability accompanied by a high-pitched cry, hypertonia, sleep disturbances, and repetitive behaviors such as yawning and sneezing bouts. Autonomic signs like tachypnea, nasal flaring, mottling, sweating, and temperature instability are common, while gastrointestinal symptoms may include feeding difficulties, regurgitation, vomiting, and loose stools or diarrhea. In severe cases, particularly with high-dose opioid or sedative exposure, seizures may occur as a withdrawal manifestation. The timing of symptom onset is closely linked to the half-life of the substance involved. For short-acting opioids like heroin, symptoms typically emerge within 6-24 hours after birth. In contrast, longer-acting opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine are associated with a delayed onset, usually between 24-72 hours, though symptoms may appear as late as 4-5 days postnatally. Similarly, withdrawal from long-acting benzodiazepines may not manifest until several days after birth. Understanding these timelines is crucial for anticipating and diagnosing NAS in affected neonates. Early recognition of the signs and their temporal relationship to maternal substance use is essential for timely intervention, as the severity of withdrawal symptoms can vary widely depending on the type, dose, and duration of prenatal exposure.",

            "concept": "Neonatal sepsis, particularly early-onset sepsis (EOS), is caused by a range of pathogens, with bacteria being the most common, followed by fungi and viruses. EOS is primarily acquired through vertical transmission from the maternal genital tract or intrauterine environment. Key maternal risk factors include chorioamnionitis (especially when confirmed by positive amniotic fluid culture or pathology), prolonged rupture of membranes (>18–24 hours), preterm labor, maternal fever, urinary tract infections, and colonization with specific bacteria. In Western countries, Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of EOS, followed by Escherichia coli, with these two pathogens accounting for most cases in term infants. However, in India, GBS is rarely isolated due to lower maternal colonization rates and the absence of routine GBS screening until recently. Instead, Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most frequently isolated pathogen in EOS, accounting for approximately 23% of cases, followed by E. coli at 14%, as reported in studies such as the National Neonatal Perinatal Database. Other Gram-negative organisms like Enterobacter and Gram-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus are also significant contributors. Listeria monocytogenes, a notable EOS pathogen in some countries, is rare in India. The overlap between pathogens causing EOS and late-onset sepsis (LOS) in Indian hospitals suggests that many EOS cases may result from exposure to hospital-acquired organisms at birth, reflecting inadequate delivery room hygiene. This is particularly concerning in settings where deliveries occur outside healthcare facilities, as infants may acquire sepsis from environmental bacteria within hours of birth. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for EOS in the presence of maternal risk factors such as foul-smelling or meconium-stained amniotic fluid, maternal fever during labor, or prolonged rupture of membranes. In India, where intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS is not routine, these clinical red flags are critical for identifying neonates at risk and initiating timely evaluation and management.",

            "concept": "Prenatal screening and maternal substance use history are critical components of neonatal care, particularly for identifying and addressing risks to the infant's well-being. Prenatal screening for congenital heart defects (CHDs) is a key strategy, with anomaly scans and fetal echocardiography serving as primary tools for early detection. However, in many settings, including India, access to advanced fetal echocardiography remains limited, leading to missed diagnoses. In such cases, the burden of detection shifts to postnatal evaluation. Pediatricians must remain vigilant in assessing antenatal risk factors, such as abnormal fetal echocardiography or high-risk maternal conditions like pregestational diabetes, which increase the likelihood of CHDs. Infants born to mothers with such risk factors should undergo focused cardiac evaluation after birth, potentially including a postnatal echocardiogram even if asymptomatic. Similarly, newborns with genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome (where approximately 50% have atrioventricular canal defects or other CHDs), Turner syndrome, or 22q11 deletion syndrome, should be electively screened with echocardiography during the neonatal period. Clinical signs in neonates, such as cyanosis, respiratory distress disproportionate to lung findings, diminished femoral pulses, concerning murmurs, or differential hand-foot coloration, warrant immediate investigation for CHDs. A meticulous physical examination within the first 1–2 days of life, including pulse palpation, pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation measurement, and careful auscultation for murmurs, is essential. It is important to note that some critical CHDs, such as transposition of the great arteries or coarctation of the aorta, may not present with a loud murmur or overt signs before ductal closure, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical suspicion. In hospitals without routine pulse oximetry screening, selective use of pulse oximetry as a diagnostic adjunct for at-risk infants can aid detection, though this approach risks missing asymptomatic cases. Universal pulse oximetry screening is recommended for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to detect CHDs in infants without known risk factors. In the context of maternal substance use, supporting the mother is integral to the infant’s health. For mothers with active substance use disorders, particularly opioid use disorder, connecting them to appropriate treatment services is crucial. Opioid agonist therapy, such as methadone maintenance or buprenorphine therapy, is the standard of care during pregnancy and postpartum, as it improves maternal retention in care and reduces relapse. Clinicians should counsel mothers on the importance of continuing such therapy after delivery to optimize outcomes for both mother and child. Compassionate, non-stigmatizing support and ensuring a safe environment are essential components of care.",

            "concept": "Neonatal sepsis, a systemic illness with bacteremia occurring within the first 28 days of life, remains a significant contributor to neonatal mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 15% of neonatal deaths. In India, the burden is particularly high, with hospital-based studies reporting an incidence of 16 per 1000 live births for culture-proven sepsis and even higher rates when clinically suspected cases are included. Clinically, neonatal sepsis is categorized based on the timing of symptom onset into early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS presents within the first 72 hours of life (extended to 7 days in some protocols) and is typically vertically transmitted from the mother during pregnancy or delivery. LOS occurs after 72 hours of age and is often acquired from the hospital environment or community postpartum. However, in resource-limited settings like India, the distinction between EOS and LOS can blur, as unsanitary delivery conditions may lead to EOS caused by pathogens typically associated with hospital-acquired infections, and LOS in the community may involve organisms resembling those seen in early infections. Neonatal sepsis can manifest as septicemia or localized infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, or urinary tract infections, but localized infections in neonates can rapidly progress to systemic involvement. The clinical presentation of neonatal sepsis is often subtle and non-specific, making early detection challenging. Neonates, especially preterm infants, have limited ability to mount localized immune responses, resulting in generalized signs of infection. Common symptoms include altered feeding behavior, such as poor feeding or difficulty accepting feeds, which may be an early indicator. Lethargy or irritability, characterized by drowsiness, inactivity, or inconsolable crying, is another red flag. Temperature instability, presenting as fever (≥38°C) or hypothermia (<36°C), is a critical sign, particularly in preterm infants who are more prone to hypothermia due to poor thermoregulation. Respiratory distress, including tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, or apnea, is a concerning feature, with apnea often being the first sign of LOS in preterm infants. Cardiovascular signs such as tachycardia (>180/min) or bradycardia (<100/min) may also be present. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the presence of perinatal risk factors, to ensure timely recognition and management of neonatal sepsis.",

            "concept": "Withdrawal scoring systems, such as the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool, play a pivotal role in the management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) by quantifying withdrawal severity and guiding treatment decisions. International guidelines, including those from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Canadian Paediatric Society, and the UK’s NICE, emphasize the use of scoring systems to tailor therapy, alongside prioritizing non-pharmacological care, initiating morphine or other opioids when indicated, and encouraging breastfeeding and rooming-in. The Finnegan scoring system, which is widely used, involves monitoring withdrawal symptoms every 3 hours to assess the need for pharmacological intervention. In India, however, the absence of formal national guidelines for NAS has led to variability in practice. While private sector NICUs with better resources are more likely to implement detailed scoring protocols like the Finnegan tool and have access to morphine or tincture of opium, public hospitals often face challenges such as high nurse-to-patient ratios and restricted availability of controlled narcotics like morphine. These constraints make it difficult to maintain frequent scoring, and clinical observation often replaces formal scoring in such settings. In resource-limited Indian hospitals, phenobarbital is commonly used as the primary treatment for NAS due to its availability and familiarity among clinicians. For example, a case series from a public hospital in Pune reported successful management of NAS with phenobarbital monotherapy, despite this approach differing from the AAP’s opioid-first strategy. While phenobarbital effectively addresses a broad spectrum of withdrawal symptoms, it does not directly target opioid receptor disturbances, potentially prolonging irritability and hospital stays. Indian clinicians must balance these limitations with practical considerations, such as resource constraints and the need for pragmatic adaptations. Access to newer adjuncts like clonidine remains limited, and its use in neonates is not widespread. As opioid use rises in certain populations, there is growing recognition of the need to standardize NAS care in India, with academic centers potentially leading efforts to develop context-specific guidelines.",

            "sequence_no": 6,
            "concept": "Newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), particularly opioid-related NAS, commonly present with central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic over-activity, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Core clinical features include tremors, jitteriness, irritability characterized by a high-pitched cry, hypertonia, sleep disturbances, and bouts of yawning and sneezing. Autonomic signs such as tachypnea, nasal flaring, mottling, sweating, and frequent yawning or sneezing are frequently observed. Feeding difficulties, including poor coordination of suck/swallow or excessive, uncoordinated sucking, are also common. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include feeding intolerance, regurgitation, vomiting, and loose stools or diarrhea. Severe cases, particularly those associated with high-dose opioid or sedative exposure, may present with seizures as a withdrawal manifestation. The timing of symptom onset is substance-dependent. For short-acting opioids like heroin, symptoms typically appear within 6–24 hours after birth, while for long-acting opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine, onset is usually delayed to 24–72 hours, sometimes extending to 4–5 days. Similarly, withdrawal from long-acting benzodiazepines may not manifest for several days. Key differentials for NAS include sepsis, hypoglycemia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage, and metabolic disorders, all of which can mimic withdrawal symptoms. These conditions must be carefully ruled out to avoid misdiagnosis. Definitive testing for NAS is based on a combination of clinical scoring systems, such as the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool, and confirmatory toxicology screens. Urine and meconium samples are commonly used for substance detection, but each has limitations. Urine samples reflect recent exposure and may miss substances used earlier in pregnancy, while meconium testing provides a longer detection window but may be unavailable if delayed collection occurs. When interpreting results, clinicians should avoid over-reliance on a single test and consider the clinical context. A thorough maternal history, including substance use during pregnancy, is critical. Misinterpretation of symptoms or test results can lead to inappropriate treatment or unnecessary interventions. Comprehensive evaluation and timely management are essential for optimizing outcomes in infants with NAS.",

            "concept": "Diagnosing neonatal sepsis requires a combination of clinical assessment and laboratory investigations due to its high stakes—untreated sepsis can be rapidly fatal, while overtreatment carries its own risks. Clinically, any neonate with unexplained illness should be evaluated for sepsis, with a detailed history focusing on risk factors such as maternal fever, foul amniotic fluid, difficult delivery, or need for resuscitation at birth for early-onset sepsis (EOS), and nursery course details or exposures for late-onset sepsis (LOS). A thorough physical examination should assess for focal infection signs, such as redness or pus at the umbilical stump (suggesting omphalitis), pustules or cellulitis on the skin, or a bulging fontanelle (indicating meningitis), which may provide clues to the source of infection. Laboratory evaluations often begin with a sepsis screen, a commonly used supportive diagnostic tool in many Indian hospitals. This screen includes a complete blood count with differential for Total Leukocyte Count (TLC) and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), Immature-to-Total neutrophil (I/T) ratio, micro-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (micro-ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The screen is considered positive if two or more of the following criteria are met: TLC < 5000 cells/mm³ (leukopenia being more indicative of sepsis than leukocytosis, though counts > 20,000–25,000 with left shift can also indicate infection), ANC below age-specific norms (e.g., < 1800–2000 in term neonates, as per Manroe’s or Mouzinho’s charts), I/T ratio > 0.2, micro-ESR > 15 mm in the first hour after the first day of life, and CRP > 10 mg/L (or > 1 mg/dL), though some protocols use CRP > 6 mg/L or require two elevated values 12–24 hours apart for improved specificity. While a negative sepsis screen strongly suggests the absence of sepsis, particularly in well-appearing neonates, a positive screen supports but does not confirm the diagnosis. Indian neonatal guidelines advise against relying solely on CRP for LOS diagnosis, emphasizing that clinical judgment remains paramount. Blood culture remains the gold standard for confirming neonatal sepsis, providing definitive evidence through pathogen isolation.",

            "concept": "Non-pharmacological management is the first-line approach for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), focusing on optimizing the infant’s environment and care to reduce symptom severity. These interventions should begin at birth or as soon as NAS is identified and continue throughout hospitalization. Key strategies include creating a low-stimulation environment by dimming lights, minimizing loud noises and alarms, and clustering care to avoid unnecessary disruptions to the infant’s sleep. Safe swaddling in a flexed posture can provide comfort and reduce irritability and tremulous movements. Gentle rocking or skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) is highly effective for calming infants and fostering bonding. Parents or consistent caregivers are encouraged to hold the infant skin-to-skin for extended periods, avoiding unnecessary handling by multiple staff members and allowing the infant to self-regulate through newborn-led feeding and sleeping. Prompt consoling by a consistent caregiver, ideally the mother, using slow rocking, reduced stimuli, or a pacifier for non-nutritive sucking can help settle the infant. Overstimulation exacerbates symptoms, so maintaining a calm, quiet approach is essential. Feeding support is another critical component, as NAS-affected infants often exhibit uncoordinated sucking or excessive hunger with poor feeding efficacy. Frequent small feeds on demand, rather than scheduled feeds, can improve intake and reduce crying due to hunger. High-calorie formula or human milk fortification may be necessary for infants sweating profusely or experiencing diarrhea to meet their higher caloric requirements stemming from increased activity and metabolic rate. Upright positioning and paced feeding can assist infants with disorganized sucking, while temporary gavage feeding may be required for those at risk of aspiration, though oral feeding is preferred to promote normal development. Rooming-in is strongly supported by evidence, as keeping the mother-infant dyad together improves NAS outcomes. Infants cared for by their mothers or consistent caregivers have lower NICU admission rates, require less pharmacologic treatment, experience shorter hospital stays, and achieve higher breastfeeding rates. If clinically stable, rooming-in should be the default approach, often involving admission to a postpartum or pediatric observation unit rather than the NICU. Many centers now implement “baby-friendly” NAS rooming-in protocols, where mothers, even those on opioid agonist treatment, are coached on consoling and caring for their infants with staff support. Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged, provided it is safe in the context of maternal substance use, as breast milk offers optimal nutrition, promotes bonding through skin-to-skin contact, and contains small quantities of opioids (if the mother is on methadone or buprenorphine), which can help attenuate withdrawal symptoms in opioid-exposed infants.",

            "sequence_no": 9,
            "concept": "Breastfeeding plays a crucial role in the non-pharmacological management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and is strongly encouraged when it is safe in the context of maternal substance use. Breast milk offers numerous benefits for NAS-affected infants. The act of breastfeeding fosters skin-to-skin contact, which promotes bonding and has a calming effect on the infant. Additionally, breast milk provides optimal nutrition and, in the case of opioid-exposed infants, may contain small quantities of opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine if the mother is undergoing treatment. These trace amounts can help attenuate withdrawal symptoms, offering a natural, gradual tapering effect. Evidence indicates that breastfeeding is associated with improved NAS outcomes, including reduced severity of withdrawal symptoms, decreased need for pharmacologic treatment, and shorter hospital stays. From a practical standpoint, breastfeeding should be initiated as early as possible and supported throughout hospitalization, provided there are no contraindications such as maternal use of illicit substances or other unsafe practices. Encouraging rooming-in, where the mother and infant remain together, further facilitates breastfeeding and strengthens maternal-infant bonding. This approach is particularly beneficial as it reduces infant stress, enhances maternal confidence, and aligns with family-centered care models. Healthcare providers should educate and support mothers in breastfeeding techniques while addressing any challenges, such as uncoordinated sucking or poor feeding efficacy, which are common in NAS-affected infants. If breastfeeding is not feasible, expressed breast milk remains a superior alternative to formula. In cases where high-calorie supplementation is necessary due to increased metabolic demands, fortification of breast milk can be considered. Overall, breastfeeding is a cornerstone of NAS care, offering both nutritional and therapeutic benefits that complement other supportive strategies.",

            "concept": "Pharmacologic treatment options for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) include morphine, methadone, and buprenorphine, each with specific dosing regimens, durations, and considerations for use. Morphine is the most commonly used first-line pharmacologic agent for NAS, with an initial dose of 0.04 mg/kg every 3–4 hours, titrated based on symptom severity. The dose can be increased incrementally by 0.01–0.02 mg/kg per dose to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg per dose. Once symptoms are controlled, weaning is typically initiated by reducing the dose by 10–20% every 48–72 hours, depending on the infant’s clinical response. Methadone is an alternative first-line option, particularly in settings where its longer half-life may provide more stable symptom control. The starting dose is 0.05–0.1 mg/kg every 6–12 hours, with adjustments made based on symptoms, and weaning is similarly gradual, reducing the dose by 10–20% every 48–72 hours. Buprenorphine, though less commonly used, is gaining attention as an effective option, with a sublingual dose of 15.9 mcg/kg every 8 hours. This dose may be titrated to a maximum of 60 mcg/kg/day, and weaning follows a similar gradual reduction protocol. For infants with allergies or intolerances to first-line agents, alternative pharmacologic options may include clonidine or phenobarbital as adjuncts or substitutes, though these are typically reserved for refractory cases. In cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) NAS, individualized protocols combining multiple agents, such as methadone with phenobarbital, may be required to achieve symptom control. Monitoring during pharmacologic treatment is critical to ensure efficacy and minimize adverse effects. Infants should be closely observed for respiratory depression, feeding difficulties, and excessive sedation. Regular scoring of withdrawal symptoms using validated tools, such as the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System, guides dose adjustments and weaning. Adverse effects, including constipation, hypotonia, and potential long-term neurodevelopmental impacts, should be promptly addressed. A multidisciplinary approach involving neonatologists, nurses, and pharmacists is essential to optimize outcomes and ensure safe and effective pharmacologic management of NAS.",

            "concept": "Hospital protocols for monitoring and treatment of neonatal sepsis and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) emphasize precise regimens, diagnostic criteria, and vigilant follow-up to optimize outcomes. Neonatal sepsis, a systemic illness with bacteremia occurring within the first 28 days of life, is a leading cause of neonatal mortality, accounting for approximately 15% of neonatal deaths globally, including an estimated 430,000 deaths in 2013. In India, the incidence of culture-proven sepsis is about 16 per 1000 live births in hospital-based studies, with higher rates when clinically suspected cases are included. Neonatal sepsis is classified as early-onset sepsis (EOS), manifesting within the first 72 hours (up to 7 days in some protocols) and typically acquired vertically from the mother, or late-onset sepsis (LOS), occurring after 72 hours and often hospital- or community-acquired. However, in resource-limited settings like India, the distinction between EOS and LOS can blur due to unsanitary delivery conditions and overlapping pathogens. Clinically, neonatal sepsis may present as septicemia or localized infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, or urinary tract infections, which can rapidly become systemic. NAS, particularly opioid-related, presents with central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic overactivity, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Common signs include tremors, jitteriness, irritability with a high-pitched cry, hypertonia, sleep disturbances, yawning, sneezing bouts, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, and gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea. Severe cases may involve seizures, especially with high-dose opioid or sedative exposure. Symptom onset varies with the substance’s half-life: heroin or short-acting opioids may cause signs within 6–24 hours, while methadone or buprenorphine withdrawal typically manifests after 24–72 hours, sometimes up to 4–5 days. Long-acting benzodiazepines may delay symptoms for several days, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may cause a milder “poor neonatal adaptation” syndrome within the first few days, usually self-resolving. Monitoring at-risk infants involves standardized tools like the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS) or its modified version, which evaluates 21 withdrawal signs to guide management and treatment decisions.",

            "concept": "The impact of polysubstance use on Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) management necessitates a focus on non-pharmacological strategies as the first-line approach, emphasizing supportive care to optimize the infant’s environment and reduce symptom severity. These interventions should commence at birth or upon identification of NAS and continue throughout hospitalization. Key strategies include creating a low-stimulation environment with dim lighting, minimal noise, and clustered care to avoid unnecessary disturbances. Safe swaddling in a flexed posture can reduce irritability and tremulous movements, while gentle rocking or skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) effectively calms the infant and fosters bonding. Parents or consistent caregivers are encouraged to hold the baby skin-to-skin for extended periods, avoid overstimulation, and console the infant promptly when distressed using slow rocking, reduced stimuli, or a pacifier for non-nutritive sucking. Feeding support is critical, as NAS-affected infants often exhibit uncoordinated sucking, excessive hunger, and poor feeding efficacy. Frequent small feeds on demand, rather than scheduled feeds, can improve intake and reduce crying due to hunger. High-calorie formula or human milk fortification may be necessary for infants with higher caloric requirements due to increased activity and metabolic rate, particularly if they are sweating profusely or experiencing diarrhea. Upright positioning and paced feeding can assist infants with disorganized suck, while temporary gavage feeding may be required for those at risk of aspiration, though oral feeding remains preferred to support normal development. Rooming-in, where the mother or consistent caregiver stays with the infant, significantly improves NAS outcomes by reducing NICU admissions, pharmacologic treatment needs, and hospital stays while enhancing breastfeeding rates and maternal bonding. Clinically stable infants should ideally be admitted to postpartum or pediatric observation units rather than NICUs, with staff supporting maternal involvement. Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged when safe, as breast milk promotes bonding, provides optimal nutrition, and contains small quantities of opioids (if the mother is on methadone or buprenorphine), which can mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Maternal presence and family-centered care are integral to successful NAS management.",

            "concept": "Maternal support and counseling during and after pregnancy are critical when addressing antibiotic treatment for typhoid fever, as undertreatment can lead to severe disease or miscarriage. Antibiotics must be chosen with both maternal and fetal safety in mind, alongside efficacy against *Salmonella Typhi*. Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cefixime, are considered safe in pregnancy and are recommended as first-line agents for complicated or inpatient cases. Indian guidelines (IAP) specifically endorse a 14-day course of oral cefixime for uncomplicated cases, while intravenous ceftriaxone is preferred for severe disease, with a step-down to oral cefixime once fever resolves. These cephalosporins cross the placenta but are not teratogenic, demonstrating an excellent safety profile during pregnancy and lactation. Ceftriaxone, in particular, has been extensively used in pregnant women with enteric fever, yielding favorable outcomes. Azithromycin, a macrolide classified as pregnancy category B, is another safe and effective option for typhoid, including multidrug-resistant strains. It is typically administered orally at 1 g daily for 7–10 days and is especially suitable for uncomplicated cases or regions with high fluoroquinolone resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights its effectiveness against most typhoid strains, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) cases. Azithromycin is also compatible with breastfeeding, as only low levels appear in breast milk, making it a preferred choice for pregnant or nursing patients when oral therapy is feasible. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillin and amoxicillin are safe alternatives in pregnancy and lactation if the *Salmonella Typhi* isolate is confirmed to be susceptible. Indian consensus guidelines recommend ampicillin 500 mg every six hours for pregnant and lactating mothers, though widespread resistance limits its use without sensitivity confirmation. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), historically a first-line agent, is now considered a second-line alternative due to resistance and safety concerns. It is pregnancy category C, posing risks such as folate antagonism in early pregnancy and neonatal jaundice near term. Folate supplementation is advised if TMP-SMX is used, and caution is warranted in breastfeeding, particularly for premature or G6PD-deficient infants. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, are generally avoided during pregnancy and lactation due to concerns about fetal cartilage damage and high resistance rates in South Asia. These drugs are not recommended as first-line agents for typhoid in children, per Indian pediatric guidelines, and should only be used in pregnant women if no safer options exist.",

            "concept": "Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are influenced by the severity of withdrawal symptoms, the type of substance exposure, and the management approach. NAS, particularly opioid-related, is characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic overactivity, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Symptoms include tremors, jitteriness, irritability with a high-pitched cry, hypertonia, sleep disturbances, frequent yawning or sneezing, temperature instability, sweating, and feeding difficulties such as poor suck-swallow coordination or excessive sucking. Severe cases, especially with high-dose opioid or sedative exposure, may present with seizures. The timing of symptom onset varies with the substance’s half-life: heroin or short-acting opioids typically induce symptoms within 6-24 hours after birth, while methadone or buprenorphine exposure leads to onset at 24-72 hours, sometimes up to 4-5 days. Long-acting benzodiazepines may delay withdrawal symptoms for several days, and infants exposed to SSRIs in utero may exhibit a milder “poor neonatal adaptation” syndrome within the first few days, often self-resolving. For bedside decision-making, standardized monitoring is essential in at-risk infants, such as those with a maternal history of opioid use or positive toxicology. The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS) is the most widely used tool, assigning points for 21 withdrawal signs to quantify severity. Initial scoring is performed within 1-2 hours after birth and repeated every 3-4 hours. Pharmacologic treatment is typically initiated if scores remain elevated, with thresholds commonly defined as ≥8 on three consecutive scores or ≥12 on two consecutive scores. While FNASS was validated in term infants, caution is advised when interpreting scores in preterm infants due to differing baseline responses. An alternative approach, the “Eat, Sleep, Console” (ESC) method, emphasizes functional assessment, focusing on whether the infant can eat effectively, sleep adequately, and be consoled. ESC prioritizes non-pharmacological interventions and minimizes maternal-infant separation. Studies have shown that ESC can reduce hospital stays (e.g., median reduction from ~15 days to 8 days) and decrease the need for pharmacologic therapy without compromising outcomes.",

            "sequence_no": 15,
            "concept": "The management of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) involves ethical considerations that vary significantly between international guidelines and the Indian context. International bodies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Canadian Paediatric Society, and the UK’s NICE emphasize prioritizing non-pharmacological care, utilizing scoring systems to guide treatment, initiating morphine or other opioids when necessary, and considering adjuncts like phenobarbital or clonidine. Breastfeeding and rooming-in are strongly encouraged whenever feasible. The World Health Organization (WHO) echoes the importance of breastfeeding and rooming-in within its broader maternal substance use guidance, though it has not issued a stand-alone NAS management guideline. In India, the absence of formal national guidelines from the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) or the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) has led clinicians to adapt Western protocols or create unit-specific approaches. This variability is partly due to historically lower NAS caseloads and resource constraints. In Indian public hospitals, where morphine availability is limited due to regulatory hurdles and high nurse-to-patient ratios challenge formal scoring systems like Finnegan scoring, phenobarbital is often used as the primary treatment. For instance, a case series by Malwade et al. documented successful management of NAS with phenobarbital monotherapy in a public hospital in Pune. While phenobarbital is readily available and addresses a broad range of withdrawal symptoms, it does not directly target opioid receptor disturbances, potentially prolonging irritability and hospital stays. In contrast, private sector NICUs with better resources are more likely to adhere to AAP recommendations, using morphine or tincture of opium and implementing detailed monitoring protocols. The lack of standardization in NAS care across India underscores the need for context-specific guidelines, particularly as opioid use rises in certain populations. While clonidine is available, it is not widely used in neonates, and newer approaches like Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) have yet to gain traction. Developing national protocols tailored to Indian settings, possibly spearheaded by academic centers, could help address these disparities and improve outcomes for infants with NAS.",

            "concept": "Neonatal thermoregulation, the process of maintaining a newborn’s body temperature within the normal range of 36.5–37.5°C axillary, is a critical determinant of newborn survival and well-being. Due to their large surface area, thin skin, and limited metabolic reserves, newborns are particularly vulnerable to rapid heat loss, which can lead to hypothermia, or excessive heat retention, resulting in hyperthermia. Both conditions pose significant risks: hypothermia increases susceptibility to infection, respiratory distress, and mortality, while hyperthermia can cause dehydration, neurological damage, and elevate the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). From a public health perspective, preventing these thermal extremes is essential and achievable through simple, cost-effective strategies that integrate clinical skills with systemic interventions. \n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF’s “warm chain” concept serves as a foundational roadmap for ensuring thermal protection across all stages of newborn care, from delivery to home environments. In India, this approach is operationalized through programs like Home-Based Newborn Care (HBNC) and Facility-Based Newborn Care (FBNC), which bridge the gap between institutional and community-level care. These initiatives emphasize education and training of healthcare workers and caregivers, particularly in resource-limited settings, to implement effective practices such as kangaroo mother care, proper use of radiant warmers, and maintaining a thermos-neutral environment. The first golden hour after birth is especially critical; ensuring warmth during this period sets the stage for optimal feeding, infection prevention, and overall growth and development. \n\nPediatricians and healthcare providers play a pivotal role in advocating for and implementing these strategies. They must ensure that every labor room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and home is equipped to maintain a safe thermal environment. Promoting kangaroo mother care, educating caregivers, and supporting policies that prioritize neonatal warmth are vital steps. In India’s diverse climatic and socio-economic context, leveraging community health networks to sustain these practices is imperative. By integrating individual clinical expertise with broader public health programs, we can uphold the fundamental need for warmth, ensuring that every newborn has the opportunity to thrive.",

            "concept": "The role of multidisciplinary teams in managing Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is critical to optimizing outcomes, as it involves coordinated efforts across various healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care. NAS, particularly opioid-related, presents with central nervous system hyperirritability, autonomic overactivity, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Symptoms include tremors, jitteriness, irritability with a high-pitched cry, hypertonia, sleep disturbances, yawning and sneezing bouts, temperature instability, sweating, and feeding difficulties such as poor suck-swallow coordination or excessive sucking. Autonomic signs like tachypnea, nasal flaring, mottling, and frequent yawning/sneezing are common, along with gastrointestinal issues such as feeding intolerance, regurgitation, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe cases, especially following high-dose opioid or sedative exposure, may lead to seizures. Symptom onset varies by substance: heroin or short-acting opioids typically manifest within 6–24 hours post-birth, methadone or buprenorphine within 24–72 hours (sometimes up to 4–5 days), and long-acting benzodiazepines several days after birth. Infants exposed to SSRIs or antidepressants may exhibit a mild “poor neonatal adaptation” syndrome within the first few days, often self-resolving. For bedside decision-making, standardized monitoring tools are essential. The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS), or its modified version, is widely used to quantify withdrawal severity, assigning points for 21 signs. For at-risk infants, scoring begins within 1–2 hours post-birth and repeats every 3–4 hours, aligning with wake-feed cycles. Pharmacologic treatment is typically initiated if Finnegan scores remain elevated beyond thresholds, such as ≥8 on three consecutive scores or ≥12 on two consecutive scores. While validated for term infants, caution is required when interpreting scores in preterm infants due to differing baseline irritability and responses. An alternative, the “Eat, Sleep, Console” (ESC) method, focuses on functional assessment of the infant’s ability to eat, sleep, and console, emphasizing non-pharmacological interventions and minimizing maternal-infant separation. Studies show ESC reduces hospital stay duration (e.g., median stay reduced from ~15 days to 8 days) and pharmacologic therapy use without compromising outcomes, highlighting the importance of family-centered care in NAS management.",

            "concept": "International guidelines, such as those from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Canadian Paediatric Society, and the UK’s NICE, emphasize prioritizing non-pharmacological care, using scoring systems to guide treatment, initiating morphine or another opioid when necessary (with phenobarbital or clonidine as adjuncts), and encouraging breastfeeding and rooming-in for managing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The World Health Organization (WHO) similarly highlights the importance of rooming-in and breastfeeding in the context of maternal opioid use, though it does not provide a stand-alone NAS guideline; its recommendations are embedded within broader maternal substance use guidance. In contrast, India lacks formal national guidelines specific to NAS. Neither the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) nor the National Neonatology Forum (NNF) has issued standardized protocols, likely due to historically lower NAS caseloads. Consequently, Indian clinicians often adapt Western protocols or develop unit-specific guidelines. A recent Indian case series highlighted the limited awareness and data on NAS, with variability in management approaches across the country. In Indian NICUs, resource availability significantly influences treatment practices. Private sector NICUs, with better resources, are more likely to implement detailed monitoring such as Finnegan scoring every three hours and use morphine or tincture of opium. In contrast, public hospitals face challenges such as high nurse-to-patient ratios and regulatory hurdles in stocking morphine, a controlled narcotic. In such settings, clinical observation and phenobarbital monotherapy are often used, as demonstrated by Malwade et al., who successfully managed three NAS cases in a public hospital in Pune with phenobarbital alone. While phenobarbital is widely available and covers a broad range of withdrawal symptoms, it does not directly address opioid receptor disturbances, potentially prolonging irritability and hospital stays. Clonidine, though available, is not commonly used in neonates in India, and novel approaches like Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) have yet to gain traction. There is growing recognition of the need for standardized NAS care in India, with academic centers potentially leading efforts to develop context-specific guidelines as opioid use rises in certain populations.",

            "sequence_no": 1,
            "concept": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a developmental defect in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to herniate into the thoracic cavity, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia and postnatal respiratory failure. Globally, it occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500–3,000 live births, with the left-sided posterolateral (Bochdalek) hernia accounting for about 85% of cases. Right-sided or anteromedial (Morgagni) hernias are less common, and Morgagni hernias often present later in infancy due to milder symptoms. The severity of CDH is primarily determined by the extent of lung hypoplasia and the degree of pulmonary hypertension caused by the herniation. In India, while the true incidence of CDH is not precisely known, it is presumed to align with global rates. However, due to higher birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain areas, the absolute number of cases is significant, and many are diagnosed postnatally. Up to 11% of CDH cases may be detected after birth even in well-equipped centers, with this percentage likely higher in regions with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up remain critical needs. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) program has improved early identification of congenital anomalies at the community level, facilitating timely referral for treatment. A major challenge in India is the uneven distribution of pediatric surgical services. While metropolitan areas have tertiary hospitals with pediatric surgeons and NICUs, rural regions often lack neonatal surgical care, necessitating long-distance transport. Neonatal transport services, such as “108 neonatal ambulance” services in some states, have improved access, but delays in referral remain a significant issue. For instance, in a Jammu series, 70% of CDH cases were referred from outside facilities, and in a Jaipur series on atresia, 25% presented after the first week of life. Training district-level physicians in neonatal stabilization and establishing regional newborn surgical centers are critical strategies to address these gaps. Outcomes for CDH in India historically lag behind high-income countries, with survival rates ranging from 40–50% overall, though tertiary centers report 50–60% survival for isolated CDH. Delayed referrals and the lack of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are key contributors to poorer outcomes. However, timely and optimal care can achieve survival rates comparable to international standards, particularly for less severe cases.",

However, due to high birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain regions, the absolute number of cases is substantial, with many diagnosed only at birth. Despite improvements in antenatal ultrasound coverage under national programs, detection rates remain inconsistent, and a significant proportion of cases, particularly CDH, are still diagnosed postnatally. Even in well-equipped centers, up to 11% of CDH cases may be identified after birth, and this figure is likely higher in areas with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up of findings are critical needs. The integration of the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) at the community level aids in early identification of visible congenital anomalies in newborns and facilitates their entry into treatment pathways. Access to pediatric surgical services in India is uneven, with tertiary hospitals and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) concentrated in metropolitan areas, leaving rural regions underserved. This disparity necessitates long-distance transport of affected neonates, often without adequate thermal or respiratory support, which increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Neonatal transport services, such as \"108 neonatal ambulance\" systems in some states, are addressing this gap, but timely access remains a challenge. For instance, 70% of CDH cases in the Jammu series were born outside and referred in, and 25% of intestinal atresia cases in the Jaipur series presented after the first week of life, indicating delays. Strategies to mitigate these issues include training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques and establishing regional newborn surgical centers to reduce dependence on distant metro facilities. Outcomes for these conditions in India historically lag behind high-income countries but are improving. CDH survival rates in tertiary centers range from 50–60% for isolated cases, lower than Western figures due to the lack of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and late referrals. Multi-center studies suggest overall survival may be around 40–50%, though timely, optimal care can yield outcomes comparable to international standards. For intestinal atresia, survival has improved from 60–70% to 80–90% in some institutions, thanks to advancements in NICU care, surgical techniques, and wider availability of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Hidden mortality, where neonates never reach surgical care, remains a concern, underscoring the importance of institutional deliveries and government initiatives like RBSK and PM-JAY. These programs provide free treatment for various congenital anomalies, including surgically correctable conditions, emphasizing the need for early detection and intervention.",

            "concept": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) plays a critical role in the management of severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), particularly in cases with significant pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). CDH, a condition characterized by herniation of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity, can lead to life-threatening respiratory distress due to lung underdevelopment and compromised pulmonary function. ECMO serves as a life-saving intervention in neonates who fail to respond to conventional therapies such as advanced mechanical ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, and pharmacologic support for PPHN. It provides cardiopulmonary support by oxygenating the blood outside the body, allowing the lungs to rest and recover while maintaining systemic oxygenation and perfusion. The decision to initiate ECMO in CDH cases requires careful bedside assessment and multidisciplinary collaboration. Indications for ECMO include severe hypoxemia unresponsive to maximal medical management, evidenced by an oxygenation index (OI) >40 or preductal oxygen saturation consistently <85% despite optimal ventilatory and pharmacologic strategies. Timing is critical, as early initiation of ECMO in the presence of refractory hypoxemia can prevent irreversible organ damage. However, ECMO is not without risks, including bleeding, infection, and complications related to anticoagulation, which necessitate meticulous monitoring and skilled management in a specialized neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Prognostication in CDH cases requiring ECMO is influenced by factors such as the degree of pulmonary hypoplasia, the presence of liver herniation, and the observed-to-expected lung-to-head ratio (O/E LHR). Extremely low O/E LHR (<25%) and significant liver herniation are associated with poorer outcomes. Survival rates for CDH with ECMO vary widely, with specialized centers reporting overall survival rates of 70–80% for CDH, though outcomes are markedly lower in severe cases. In resource-limited settings, timely access to ECMO remains a challenge, emphasizing the need for regionalization of care and the development of neonatal transport systems to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.",

            "concept": "Preoperative stabilization protocols for neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in India must account for unique epidemiological and healthcare system challenges. While the global incidence of CDH is approximately 1 in 2500 live births, the absolute number of cases in India is high due to elevated birth rates and uneven antenatal screening coverage. Detection of CDH remains suboptimal, with up to 11% of cases diagnosed postnatally in well-equipped centers, and likely higher in areas with limited prenatal scanning. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up are critical steps, supported by programs like Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), which help identify newborns with visible congenital anomalies and direct them into treatment pathways. However, timely access to pediatric surgical services is a major challenge, as rural areas often lack neonatal surgical coverage, necessitating long-distance transport. Referral transport is frequently done without adequate thermal care or respiratory support, increasing risks for these fragile neonates. Neonatal transport services, such as “108 neonatal ambulance” systems in certain states, are addressing this gap, but delays persist. For instance, in the Jammu series on CDH, 70% of cases were born outside and referred in, while the Jaipur series on intestinal atresia reported 25% of cases presenting after the first week of life. To mitigate these delays, training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques, such as the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), insertion of nasogastric tubes, and initiation of intravenous fluids, is essential. Establishing regional newborn surgical centers can further reduce dependence on distant metro hospitals. Outcomes for CDH in India vary widely, with survival rates of 50–60% reported in tertiary centers for isolated cases, compared to higher figures in Western countries due to the lack of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and late referrals. Multi-center studies suggest overall survival rates of 40–50% for referred cases, though timely and optimal care can achieve near-international outcomes for less severe CDH. For intestinal atresia, survival has improved from 60–70% historically to 80–90% in some institutions, driven by advancements in NICU care, surgical techniques, and greater availability of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Addressing hidden mortality—cases that never reach a surgeon—remains a priority, emphasizing the importance of institutional deliveries and robust government schemes like RBSK and PM-JAY for early detection and free treatment of congenital anomalies.",

            "sequence_no": 5,
            "concept": "The surgical management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair involves meticulous technique tailored to the type and location of the defect. Duodenal atresia, a common condition associated with CDH, is most frequently addressed through a duodeno-duodenostomy, often employing the diamond-shaped anastomosis known as the Kimura technique, to bypass or resect the atretic segment. In cases of a duodenal web with a small perforation, excision of the web via duodenotomy may suffice. This procedure is typically performed through an upper abdominal transverse incision. Since many duodenal atresias occur distal to the ampulla, preoperative bilious aspirates are common. Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube is left in the stomach, and a trans-anastomotic tube or tube duodenostomy is generally unnecessary. Repairs are usually completed in one stage, even in special situations such as an associated annular pancreas, where the pancreas is bypassed but not resected. If duodenal atresia coexists with malrotation or proximal jejunal atresia, these conditions are corrected in the same surgical session whenever feasible. For jejunoileal atresia, the abdomen is opened via a midline incision, and the atresias are classified into Types I to IV based on morphology. The surgical objective is to resect the blind ends and perform a primary anastomosis of healthy bowel segments. Discrepancies in bowel size, such as a dilated proximal segment and a narrow distal segment, may necessitate tapering or partial tapering enteroplasty. In complex cases, such as multiple atresias or questionable bowel viability, a staged approach may be employed, involving the creation of a proximal stoma and distal mucus fistula, with reanastomosis performed later. Approximately 17.5% of jejunoileal atresia cases, particularly Type IIIb or IV, require a stoma instead of primary anastomosis. Colonic atresia, though rare, is managed by resecting the atretic segment and performing a primary anastomosis if possible; otherwise, a proximal stoma with a distal mucus fistula may be created in unstable infants. Laparoscopic techniques are increasingly used in specialized centers for stable neonates, particularly for colonic or distal ileal atresias, but open surgery remains the standard in most settings. During surgery, other anomalies, such as Meckel’s diverticulum or additional atretic segments, are thoroughly evaluated. Postoperatively, abdominal closure is completed, and a central line is often placed for total parenteral nutrition (TPN), with the infant typically kept intubated during the immediate recovery period for safety.",

            "sequence_no": 6,
            "concept": "Pulmonary hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a critical determinant of neonatal outcomes, as it results from the herniation of abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity, leading to compromised lung development and postnatal respiratory failure. CDH occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500–3,000 live births, with left-sided posterolateral (Bochdalek) hernias accounting for around 85% of cases. The severity of pulmonary hypoplasia and associated pulmonary hypertension directly influences prognosis. In India, the true incidence of CDH is presumed to align with global rates, but the absolute number of cases is significant due to high birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain regions. While antenatal ultrasound detection of CDH is improving under national programs, a substantial proportion of cases are still diagnosed postnatally, with some reports indicating that up to 11% of CDH cases are identified after birth even in well-equipped centers. This figure is likely higher in areas with fewer prenatal scans, underscoring the need to strengthen antenatal anomaly detection and follow-up. Timely access to pediatric surgical care remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas where neonatal surgical services are scarce. Many infants with CDH are transported long distances to tertiary centers, often without adequate thermal or respiratory support, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Neonatal transport services, such as the “108 neonatal ambulance” in some states, aim to address this gap, but delays in referral persist. Training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques, such as NRP, nasogastric tube insertion, and intravenous fluid administration, along with the establishment of regional newborn surgical centers, could mitigate these delays. Survival outcomes for CDH in India vary widely, with tertiary centers reporting rates of 50–60% for isolated CDH, which remain lower than those in high-income countries due to factors like late referrals and limited ECMO availability. However, timely and optimal care can yield outcomes comparable to international standards, particularly in less severe cases. Addressing hidden mortality through initiatives like RBSK and promoting institutional deliveries are crucial steps toward improving overall survival rates.",

            "sequence_no": 7,
            "concept": "In the context of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and intestinal atresia, associated anomalies are critical considerations for paediatric post-graduates. CDH is associated with anomalies in up to 40–50% of cases, including cardiac defects, neural tube defects, and chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21. Similarly, intestinal atresia, particularly duodenal atresia, is linked to Down syndrome in approximately 30% of cases and may coexist with other gastrointestinal anomalies like malrotation or annular pancreas. These associations necessitate a thorough evaluation of every diagnosed case to identify coexisting conditions that may influence management and prognosis. From a practical standpoint, bedside decision-making begins with a high index of suspicion for associated anomalies in any neonate presenting with CDH or intestinal atresia. For CDH, postnatal echocardiography is essential to assess for structural cardiac anomalies, which can significantly impact surgical planning and outcomes. Additionally, a detailed neurological examination and cranial imaging should be considered to rule out neural tube defects. For intestinal atresia, a karyotype or chromosomal microarray is recommended, especially in cases of duodenal atresia, to confirm or exclude Down syndrome. Abdominal imaging, such as an upper gastrointestinal contrast study, is critical to identify associated gastrointestinal anomalies like malrotation. Timely identification of these anomalies is crucial for optimizing outcomes. For example, the presence of a major cardiac defect in CDH may necessitate a staged surgical approach or influence the decision to use extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in centers where it is available. In intestinal atresia, the detection of associated anomalies like annular pancreas may alter the surgical technique. Furthermore, the presence of chromosomal abnormalities or syndromic associations requires multidisciplinary care involving geneticists, cardiologists, and neonatologists. Early recognition and management of these anomalies not only improve survival rates but also enhance the quality of life for affected neonates.",

            "sequence_no": 8,
            "concept": "Long-term outcomes and follow-up care for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) in India are influenced by epidemiological factors, healthcare infrastructure, and government initiatives. The true incidence of CDH in India is not precisely known but is presumed to be similar to global rates (~1 in 2500 live births). However, due to higher birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain areas, many cases are detected only at birth. While antenatal ultrasound coverage is improving under national programs, detection rates remain variable. Up to 11% of CDH cases may still be diagnosed postnatally in well-equipped centers, and this proportion is likely higher in regions with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up care is critical. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) program, integrated at the community level, plays an essential role in identifying newborns with visible congenital anomalies early and directing them into treatment pathways. Access to pediatric surgical services remains uneven, with tertiary hospitals concentrated in metro cities while rural areas often lack neonatal surgical coverage. This disparity necessitates long-distance transport for many infants, which poses risks such as inadequate thermal care and respiratory support during transit. Neonatal transport services, such as the “108 neonatal ambulance” in some states, are addressing these challenges, but timely access remains a concern. For example, in the Jammu series on CDH, 70% of cases were born outside and referred in, while in the Jaipur series on intestinal atresia, 25% presented after the first week of life, reflecting delays. Training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques (e.g., NRP, NG tube insertion, IV fluids) and establishing regional newborn surgical centers are practical strategies to improve outcomes. Outcomes for CDH in India historically lag behind high-income countries, with survival rates ranging from 50–60% in tertiary centers for isolated CDH, compared to higher rates internationally. Late referrals and lack of ECMO contribute to this disparity. Multi-center studies suggest overall survival may be closer to 40–50% when including referred cases, though timely and optimal care can achieve outcomes near international standards for less severe cases. For intestinal atresia, survival has improved from 60–70% in older data to 80–90% in institutions with better NICU care, surgical techniques, and TPN availability. However, hidden mortality—babies who never reach a surgeon—remains a concern, underscoring the importance of RBSK and institutional deliveries.",

            "sequence_no": 9,
            "concept": "Intestinal atresia refers to a congenital obstruction or discontinuity in the gastrointestinal tract, and its classification is critical for diagnosis and management. The most widely accepted classification system, first described by Grosfeld, divides intestinal atresia into four types based on the anatomical defect. Type I involves a mucosal web or membrane that obstructs the lumen while the bowel wall remains intact. Type II is characterized by a complete discontinuity of the bowel with a fibrous cord connecting the two blind ends. Type IIIA presents as a complete separation of the bowel without any connecting tissue, often associated with a mesenteric defect. Type IIIB, also known as \"apple-peel\" or \"Christmas tree\" deformity, features a proximal jejunal atresia with the distal small bowel coiled around a single vascular pedicle due to the absence of the superior mesenteric artery. Type IV is the most severe form, involving multiple atresias throughout the bowel, often described as a \"string of sausages.\" \n\nFor bedside decision-making, it is essential to recognize that the type of atresia significantly influences surgical planning and prognosis. Type I atresia may be managed with simple excision of the membrane, while Type II and IIIA require end-to-end anastomosis. Type IIIB demands careful vascular assessment and bowel length preservation due to the risk of short bowel syndrome. Type IV poses the greatest surgical challenge, often necessitating multiple anastomoses and long-term nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Early diagnosis is crucial; antenatal ultrasound may reveal polyhydramnios or dilated bowel loops, but many cases are diagnosed postnatally due to feeding intolerance, bilious vomiting, or abdominal distension. Stabilization before surgery includes nasogastric decompression, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. In resource-limited settings, delays in diagnosis and referral can worsen outcomes, emphasizing the need for robust neonatal transport systems and regional surgical centers. Improved NICU care, surgical techniques, and access to TPN have markedly enhanced survival rates, with recent data indicating outcomes of 80-90% in well-equipped centers.",

            "sequence_no": 10,
            "concept": "Intestinal atresia, a congenital condition characterized by obstruction or absence of a segment of the intestine, is a significant neonatal surgical emergency. Core clinical features include bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium within the first 24–48 hours of life. In cases of duodenal atresia, the classic \"double bubble\" sign is seen on abdominal X-rays due to gas accumulation in the stomach and proximal duodenum. For other types of atresia, plain X-rays typically reveal multiple air-fluid levels, indicative of distal obstruction. Contrast studies, such as an upper gastrointestinal series or contrast enema, are definitive tests to delineate the level and nature of the obstruction. These studies have high sensitivity and specificity when performed correctly, but care must be taken to avoid overdistension or perforation during the procedure. Key differentials for intestinal atresia include meconium ileus, Hirschsprung disease, and midgut volvulus. Meconium ileus may present similarly but is often associated with cystic fibrosis and demonstrates a \"soap bubble\" appearance on X-rays. Hirschsprung disease, caused by aganglionosis of the distal bowel, is diagnosed with rectal biopsy, while volvulus is an acute surgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis via imaging, often with an upper GI series showing a \"corkscrew\" appearance. Sampling pitfalls in imaging include improper positioning, failure to include the entire abdomen in the field of view, and misinterpretation of overlapping bowel loops. To avoid diagnostic errors, clinicians must ensure adequate bowel preparation for contrast studies and use age-appropriate contrast agents. Interpretation of imaging should consider the clinical context, as isolated findings may be misleading. For example, the \"double bubble\" sign is highly specific for duodenal atresia but can occasionally be seen in other conditions like annular pancreas. In summary, timely diagnosis of intestinal atresia relies on a combination of clinical suspicion, appropriate imaging modalities, and careful interpretation of findings. Early identification and stabilization, followed by surgical correction, are critical to improving outcomes in affected neonates.",

In cases of duodenal web with a small perforation, excision of the web via duodenotomy may suffice. The procedure is typically carried out through an upper abdominal transverse incision. Preoperatively, bilious aspirates are common due to the frequent distal location of the atresia relative to the ampulla, allowing bile to reach the proximal segment. Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube is left in the stomach, but trans-anastomotic tubes or tube duodenostomies are generally unnecessary. Repairs are usually completed in a single stage. If duodenal atresia is associated with an annular pancreas, the surgical approach remains the same, bypassing the obstruction without resecting the pancreas. In cases where duodenal atresia coexists with other anomalies, such as malrotation or proximal jejunal atresia (“double trouble”), simultaneous correction during the same surgical sitting is preferred when feasible. For bedside decision-making, it is essential to recognize that duodenal repairs are straightforward in most cases, with a single-stage approach being standard. However, careful preoperative assessment is crucial, particularly in complex cases involving additional anomalies. The presence of bilious aspirates can help confirm the diagnosis and guide surgical planning. Postoperatively, monitoring for complications such as anastomotic leaks or bowel dysmotility is critical. While nasogastric decompression is routinely employed, the use of additional tubes is generally unnecessary unless specific complications arise. In cases of associated malrotation or jejunal atresia, simultaneous correction minimizes the need for future surgeries, provided the infant’s condition permits. Overall, duodenal atresia repair is a well-established procedure with predictable outcomes when performed in a timely and systematic manner.",

            "sequence_no": 12,
            "concept": "The surgical management of jejunoileal atresia requires a tailored approach based on the type and morphology of the atresia. Jejunoileal atresias are classified into four types: Type I involves a mucosal web; Type II presents with fibrous cord separation; Type III features a gap with a mesenteric defect; Type IIIb, known as \"apple-peel\" atresia, includes a segment of bowel fed by a marginal artery; and Type IV involves multiple atresias. Surgical intervention typically begins with a midline abdominal incision, allowing the surgeon to inspect the bowel and assess the extent of the atresia. The primary goal is to resect the blind ends and perform a primary anastomosis of healthy bowel segments. However, due to the frequent discrepancy in bowel size—where the proximal segment is dilated and hypertrophied while the distal segment is narrow from disuse—a partial tapering enteroplasty may be performed to facilitate anastomosis. In cases of multiple atresias or questionable bowel viability, a staged approach may be necessary. This involves creating a proximal stoma and distal mucus fistula, followed by a second surgery to rejoin the bowel after recovery. Approximately 17.5% of jejunoileal atresia cases, particularly complex Type IIIb or IV cases, require stoma formation rather than primary anastomosis, often due to contamination or perforation. During surgery, the surgeon must also inspect the bowel for additional atretic segments, as Type IV cases may involve multiple areas of obstruction. Meckel’s diverticulum should also be ruled out. If all segments cannot be addressed in one operation, stomas may be left for subsequent procedures. Postoperatively, abdominal closure is performed, and a central line is often placed for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Intubation is typically maintained during the immediate postoperative period, especially if abdominal distension or heavy narcotic use was involved. While laparoscopic-assisted approaches are increasingly reported for distal ileal or colonic atresias in specialized centers, open surgery remains the standard in most settings due to equipment and expertise limitations in neonates.",

            "sequence_no": 13,
            "concept": "Postoperative care and complications in intestinal atresia require meticulous attention to early and late complications, vigilant monitoring for red-flag signs, understanding the underlying pathophysiology, and ensuring appropriate bedside management, escalation, and follow-up. Early complications include anastomotic leaks, which can present with abdominal distension, bilious drainage from the nasogastric tube, or signs of peritonitis. Late complications may involve adhesive small bowel obstruction, anastomotic strictures, and short bowel syndrome, particularly in cases of extensive bowel resection. Dysmotility, especially in colonic atresia, can persist postoperatively. Red-flag warning signs include persistent bilious vomiting, failure to pass stools, abdominal distension, fever, or signs of sepsis, which necessitate immediate evaluation for potential complications such as leaks, obstruction, or infection. The pathophysiology of intestinal atresia involves congenital interruption of the bowel lumen, often due to vascular insults during fetal development. Duodenal atresia is frequently associated with bile-stained aspirates preoperatively due to its typical location distal to the ampulla. Jejunoileal atresias are classified into Types I to IV based on morphology, with Type IIIb (“apple-peel” atresia) and Type IV (multiple atresias) being the most complex. Colonic atresia, though rare, poses unique challenges due to significant dysmotility. Bedside monitoring postoperatively includes close observation of vital signs, abdominal girth, nasogastric tube output, and stool passage. Any signs of hemodynamic instability, worsening abdominal distension, or bilious output should prompt immediate escalation. A central line is often placed for total parenteral nutrition (TPN), as enteral feeds are delayed until bowel function recovers. Imaging studies, such as contrast studies or ultrasonography, may be warranted to evaluate suspected complications. Definitive management involves surgical correction tailored to the type and location of atresia. Duodenal atresia is commonly repaired with a duodeno-duodenostomy, while jejunoileal atresias require resection of blind ends and primary anastomosis, with stomas reserved for complex cases or contamination. Colonic atresia typically allows for primary anastomosis. Postoperative follow-up focuses on nutritional rehabilitation, monitoring for growth, and addressing long-term complications such as strictures or dysmotility. In specialized centers, laparoscopic approaches may be employed, though open surgery remains the standard in most settings.",

            "concept": "Nutritional management in neonates with intestinal atresia is a critical aspect of care, as these infants often present with significant gastrointestinal dysfunction pre- and postoperatively. The primary goal is to ensure adequate nutrition while allowing the bowel to recover and adapt. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is the cornerstone of nutritional support in the immediate postoperative period, especially for neonates with jejunoileal or colonic atresia, where bowel continuity may not be immediately restored. A central line is typically placed during or after surgery to facilitate TPN, which provides essential nutrients while bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. The duration of TPN depends on the type and extent of atresia, the success of surgical repair, and the time required for the bowel to regain sufficient function to tolerate enteral feeds. Enteral feeding is introduced cautiously once bowel function resumes, as evidenced by the resolution of postoperative ileus, the passage of stool, and the absence of significant abdominal distension. For neonates with duodenal atresia, where surgical repair often involves a duodeno-duodenostomy, enteral feeds can typically be initiated sooner due to the relatively preserved bowel length and function. In contrast, neonates with jejunoileal or colonic atresia, especially those requiring staged surgeries or with significant bowel resection, may experience delayed enteral feeding initiation. The risk of short bowel syndrome is higher in cases involving extensive bowel resection, particularly in complex Type IIIb (\"apple-peel\") or Type IV jejunoileal atresias, where multiple atretic segments are present. Breast milk is the preferred enteral feed due to its immunological and trophic benefits, but hydrolyzed or elemental formulas may be used in cases of malabsorption. Close monitoring of growth parameters, electrolyte levels, and signs of feeding intolerance is essential. Multidisciplinary care involving neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, and dietitians is crucial to optimize outcomes. Transitioning from TPN to full enteral feeds requires careful titration, and some neonates may need prolonged nutritional support, including home TPN, if intestinal adaptation is incomplete.",

            "concept": "Management of short bowel syndrome following intestinal atresia surgery requires a tailored surgical approach based on the type and location of the atresia. For duodenal atresia, the most common repair is a duodeno-duodenostomy, often performed using the diamond-shaped Kimura technique to bypass or resect the atretic segment. In cases of a duodenal web with a small perforation, excising the web via duodenotomy may suffice. This procedure is typically performed through an upper abdominal transverse incision. Since many duodenal atresias are distal to the ampulla, bilious aspirates are common preoperatively. Post-repair, a nasogastric tube is left in the stomach, and trans-anastomotic tubes or tube duodenostomies are generally unnecessary. Repairs are typically completed in one stage, even in special situations such as annular pancreas or concurrent malrotation and proximal jejunal atresia. For jejunoileal atresia, the abdomen is opened via a midline incision, and the bowel is inspected. Atresias are classified into Types I to IV based on morphology, with Type IIIb (\"apple-peel\" atresia) and Type IV (multiple atresias) being more complex. The surgical goal is to resect blind ends and perform primary anastomosis of healthy bowel segments. When a significant size discrepancy exists between the dilated proximal segment and the narrow distal segment, tapering enteroplasty may be performed to facilitate anastomosis. In cases of multiple atresias, dubious bowel viability, or significant contamination/perforation, a staged approach with proximal stoma and distal mucus fistula may be chosen. Approximately 17.5% of jejunoileal atresia cases, often Type IIIb or IV, require stoma creation rather than primary anastomosis. Colonic atresia, though rare, involves resection and primary anastomosis when feasible, with stoma creation reserved for unstable infants or severely distended colons. While laparoscopic-assisted approaches are possible in specialized centers for stable neonates, open surgery remains the standard in most settings. During surgery, the bowel is inspected for additional atretic segments, Meckel’s diverticulum, or other anomalies. Postoperatively, abdominal closure is performed, and a central line is often placed for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Intubation is typically maintained in the immediate postoperative period, especially in cases of abdominal distension or heavy narcotic use.",

            "concept": "Complications such as volvulus or bowel obstruction following surgery for congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) or intestinal atresia can present as early or late postoperative challenges. Early complications typically include anastomotic leaks, bowel ischemia, or volvulus, which may manifest within the first few days post-surgery. Late complications, such as adhesive bowel obstruction or recurrent volvulus, may occur weeks to months later. Red-flag warning signs include bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, failure to pass stools, or signs of sepsis such as fever, lethargy, and poor perfusion. Prompt recognition of these signs is critical, as delays in intervention can lead to bowel necrosis or perforation, significantly worsening outcomes. The pathophysiology underlying these complications often relates to surgical factors, such as tension at the anastomotic site, inadequate blood supply to the bowel, or postoperative adhesions. Volvulus, in particular, arises from abnormal bowel fixation, leading to twisting of the mesentery and compromised vascular supply. These processes can result in bowel obstruction, ischemia, or perforation if not promptly addressed. Bedside monitoring in the postoperative period should focus on early detection of complications. Regular assessment of abdominal girth, bowel sounds, and stool output is essential, along with vigilant monitoring for signs of sepsis or hemodynamic instability. Escalation of care is warranted if red-flag signs are observed, and this may include imaging such as abdominal X-rays or ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis. In cases of volvulus, a \"whirlpool sign\" on Doppler ultrasound is diagnostic, while bowel obstruction may show dilated loops with air-fluid levels on X-ray. Definitive management involves urgent surgical exploration in cases of volvulus or bowel obstruction. The affected bowel may require resection, with re-anastomosis or stoma creation depending on the extent of damage. Postoperatively, nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if indicated, and careful fluid-electrolyte management are crucial. Long-term follow-up is necessary to monitor for growth, nutritional adequacy, and recurrence of complications, ensuring timely intervention if needed. Strengthening antenatal and neonatal care pathways, including early referral and access to pediatric surgical expertise, remains vital to improving outcomes.",

            "concept": "In India, the true incidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and intestinal atresias is not precisely known but is presumed to align with global rates (CDH ~1 in 2500 live births; duodenal atresia ~1 in 5000). However, higher birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain regions result in a large absolute number of cases, many of which are detected only at birth. While antenatal ultrasound coverage is improving under national programs, detection rates remain variable. Up to 11% of CDH cases may still be diagnosed postnatally even in well-equipped centers, with higher rates expected in areas with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up are critical needs. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) plays a significant role in early identification of visible congenital anomalies at the community level, facilitating timely referral and treatment. Despite these efforts, access to pediatric surgical services remains uneven, with tertiary hospitals and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) concentrated in metropolitan areas, leaving rural regions underserved. This disparity forces many neonates to undergo long-distance transport, often without adequate thermal or respiratory support, which increases mortality risk. Neonatal transport services, such as the “108 neonatal ambulance” initiative in some states, are addressing this gap, but delays persist. For example, in a Jammu series on CDH, 70% of cases were born outside and referred in, while in a Jaipur series on intestinal atresia, 25% presented after the first week of life. Training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques, such as NRP, nasogastric tube insertion, and IV fluid administration, alongside the establishment of regional newborn surgical centers, could mitigate these delays. Outcomes for CDH and intestinal atresia in India historically lag behind high-income countries, with survival for isolated CDH reported at 50–60% in tertiary centers and overall survival likely around 40–50% when including referred cases. Intestinal atresia survival has improved from 60–70% to 80–90% in some institutions due to advancements in NICU care, surgical techniques, and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) availability. Hidden mortality, where neonates fail to reach surgical care, remains a concern, underscoring the importance of RBSK and institutional deliveries.",

            "concept": "Anesthetic considerations in neonatal surgery in India are influenced by unique epidemiological, logistical, and systemic factors. The true incidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and intestinal atresias is not precisely known but is presumed to align with global rates (~1 in 2500 live births for CDH and ~1 in 5000 for duodenal atresia). However, due to higher birth rates and limited antenatal screening in certain regions, many cases are detected only at birth. Antenatal ultrasound coverage is improving under national programs, yet detection rates remain variable. Postnatal diagnosis is common, with up to 11% of CDH cases identified after birth even in well-equipped centers, and likely higher in areas with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up remains a critical need. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) program aids early identification of visible congenital anomalies and facilitates treatment pathways, although CDH and intestinal atresias are not explicitly listed but fall under treatable surgical birth defects. Access to pediatric surgical services is uneven, with tertiary hospitals concentrated in metro cities while rural areas often lack neonatal surgical coverage. This results in many neonates being transported long distances, often without adequate thermal or respiratory support, increasing risks during referral. Neonatal transport services, such as the “108 neonatal ambulance” in some states, are addressing this gap, but delays persist. For instance, in the Jammu series on CDH, 70% of cases were born outside and referred in, while the Jaipur series on intestinal atresia reported 25% of cases presenting after the first week of life. Strategies to mitigate these delays include training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization techniques, such as neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) protocols, nasogastric tube insertion, and IV fluid administration, as well as establishing regional newborn surgical centers to reduce reliance on distant metro facilities. Outcomes for neonatal surgical conditions in India historically lag behind high-income countries but are improving. Survival rates for isolated CDH in tertiary centers range from 50–60%, lower than Western figures due to the lack of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and late referrals. A multi-center Indian study might show overall survival rates of 40–50% when including referred cases, though timely and optimal care can achieve outcomes near international standards for less severe cases. For intestinal atresias, survival has improved from 60–70% in older data to 80–90% in some institutions, aided by advancements in NICU care, surgical techniques, and wider availability of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Hidden mortality, where neonates fail to reach surgical care, remains a concern, emphasizing the importance of institutional deliveries and programs like RBSK.",

            "concept": "In India, the true incidence of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and intestinal atresias is not precisely known but is presumed to align with global rates (CDH ~1 in 2500 live births; duodenal atresia ~1 in 5000). However, higher birth rates and limited antenatal screening in some regions result in a significant absolute number of cases, many of which are detected only at birth. Despite improving antenatal ultrasound coverage under national programs, detection rates remain variable. For instance, up to 11% of CDH cases may still be diagnosed postnatally even in well-equipped centers, and this figure is likely higher in areas with fewer prenatal scans. Strengthening antenatal anomaly scans and ensuring follow-up on findings is a critical need. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) program has been instrumental in identifying newborns with visible congenital anomalies early and directing them into treatment pathways. However, access to pediatric surgical services remains uneven, with tertiary hospitals concentrated in metro cities while rural areas often lack neonatal surgical coverage. This disparity necessitates long-distance transport of neonates, which poses additional risks, particularly when referral transport lacks proper thermal and respiratory support. Neonatal transport services, such as the “108 neonatal ambulance” in some states, are addressing this gap, but timely access remains a challenge. For example, in the Jammu series on CDH, 70% of cases were referred from outside, and in the Jaipur series on atresia, 25% presented after the first week of life, reflecting delays in care. Training district-level general physicians in neonatal stabilization (e.g., NRP, NG tube insertion, IV fluids) and establishing regional newborn surgical centers could mitigate these delays. Outcomes for CDH and intestinal atresia in India historically lag behind high-income countries, with CDH survival ranging from 40–60% and intestinal atresia survival improving to 80–90% in some institutions due to advancements in NICU care, surgical techniques, and TPN availability. Government schemes like RBSK and PM-JAY provide critical support by covering surgical birth defects, emphasizing the importance of institutional deliveries and early intervention.",

            "concept": "A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for neonatal surgical care, particularly in managing intestinal atresias, which require precise surgical planning and coordination across specialties. The type and location of the atresia dictate the surgical strategy. For duodenal atresia, the most common repair is a duodeno-duodenostomy, often performed as a diamond-shaped anastomosis (Kimura technique) via an upper abdominal transverse incision. If a duodenal web with a small perforation is present, excision via duodenotomy may suffice. Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube is typically placed, while trans-anastomotic tubes or tube duodenostomies are generally unnecessary. Duodenal repairs are usually completed in one stage, even in cases with associated conditions such as annular pancreas or malrotation. Concurrent anomalies, such as proximal jejunal atresia, are addressed during the same surgical session whenever feasible. For jejunoileal atresia, the surgical approach involves a midline incision to inspect and classify the atresia (Types I-IV). The primary goal is to resect blind ends and create a primary anastomosis between healthy bowel segments. In cases of significant size discrepancy between the proximal dilated and distal narrowed segments, tapering or partial tapering enteroplasty may be required. Complex cases, such as Type IIIb (“apple-peel” atresia) or Type IV (multiple atresias), may necessitate a staged approach, including the creation of a proximal stoma and distal mucus fistula, with reanastomosis planned for a later stage. Approximately 17.5% of jejunoileal atresia cases require stoma formation, particularly in cases with contamination or perforation. Colonic atresia, though rare, is managed by resecting the atretic segment and performing a primary anastomosis when feasible. If the infant is unstable or the colon is significantly distended, a proximal stoma with a distal mucus fistula may be necessary. While short bowel syndrome is less common in colonic atresia, postoperative dysmotility can be a concern. Laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted approaches are increasingly used in specialized centers for stable neonates, but open surgery remains the standard in most settings due to equipment and expertise limitations. In all cases, intraoperative assessment for additional anomalies, such as Meckel’s diverticulum or further atretic segments, is critical. Postoperatively, central line placement for TPN and careful monitoring during the immediate recovery period, including intubation, are standard practices to ensure optimal outcomes.",

If it’s a duodenal web with a small perforation, sometimes just excising the web via duodenotomy is enough. The procedure is [...]"

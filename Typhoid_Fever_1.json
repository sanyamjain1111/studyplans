            "sequence_no": 1,
            "concept": "Typhoid fever in children presents a significant global and regional burden, with clinical manifestations varying widely by age, geographic region, and underlying health status. Fever is nearly universal in paediatric cases, occurring in 97–100% of children, though younger children may exhibit lower fever or hypothermia. Regional variability is evident in symptoms such as relative bradycardia, which is 15 times more likely in African children compared to Asian children. Gastrointestinal symptoms also differ; diarrhoea is more than 2.5 times more common in infants than older children, while constipation, associated with relapse, affects some children. Vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal pain are frequent but nonspecific, with 36.7% of children in a Pakistani study presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting, and one-third experiencing constipation. Dry cough occurs in 22.4% of cases, highlighting the possibility of respiratory symptoms. Severe complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation are nine times more common in hospital-based studies, reflecting referral bias and severity. Paralytic ileus is seven times more frequent in African children than Asian children, suggesting differences in strain virulence or nutritional status. Neurologic complications, including febrile seizures in children aged 6–60 months and encephalopathy in severe cases, are more common in children than adults. Rare manifestations such as ataxia, cerebellar syndrome, and splenic rupture, often linked to multidrug-resistant infections, underscore the importance of early recognition and treatment.\n\nTransmission is influenced by chronic carriers, who are rare in children but may occur in those with structural biliary abnormalities or gallstones, contributing to ongoing disease spread. Key risk factors include malnutrition, coinfections such as malaria or helminthiasis, and genetic predispositions, which may explain geographic differences in haematologic abnormalities such as severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia, both significantly higher in African children. Antimicrobial resistance patterns vary regionally; in South Asia, resistance to first-line antibiotics and rising minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ceftriaxone have led to prolonged illness and complications. In contrast, some African regions show susceptibility to older antibiotics but higher rates of severe disease. Caregivers should ensure proper sanitation, early medical attention, and adherence to prescribed antibiotic regimens to mitigate risks. Public health surveillance and tailored clinical management are crucial in high-burden settings to address regional variability and improve paediatric outcomes.",

            "sequence_no": 2,
            "concept": "The clinical presentation of typhoid fever in children varies by age, but recognizing red flags for severe or complicated cases is crucial for timely intervention. Severe typhoid fever may manifest with persistent high-grade fever, profound bacteremia, and rapid progression to septic shock, particularly in immunocompromised pediatric patients. These children, who may have conditions such as HIV infection, primary immunodeficiencies (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease), neutropenia, or long-term corticosteroid use, are at higher risk due to impaired cell-mediated immunity, which leads to higher bacterial loads and delayed clearance of Salmonella. Red flags for complications include signs of intestinal perforation, such as new-onset severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, guarding, and peritonitis. Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasound or plain radiographs, may reveal free fluid or free air under the diaphragm, respectively. Clinicians should maintain a low threshold for imaging in cases of atypical presentations or prolonged bacteremia. For bedside decision-making, prompt hospital admission and aggressive management are essential for children with suspected severe or complicated typhoid fever. Parenteral antibiotics should be initiated early, with third-generation cephalosporins like ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day intravenously in one or two divided doses) or cefotaxime (100–200 mg/kg/day) as preferred first-line agents. In cases of extensively drug-resistant typhoid, carbapenems (e.g., imipenem or meropenem) combined with azithromycin may be required, guided by local susceptibility data. Treatment duration should be extended to at least 14 days, continuing for seven days after defervescence to reduce relapse risk. Blood cultures should be repeated after 72 hours and weekly until negative. Supportive care includes intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and monitoring for complications such as encephalopathy, meningitis, osteomyelitis, or intestinal perforation. In severe typhoid encephalopathy, dexamethasone (3 mg/kg intravenously followed by 1 mg/kg every six hours for 48 hours) may reduce mortality but should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients. Multidrug-resistant typhoid fever requires escalation of therapy if the child fails to respond within 72 hours, based on culture results and local resistance patterns.

On examination, he appears lethargic, with a temperature of 39.8°C, heart rate of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. His abdomen is distended and tender, with guarding and rebound tenderness in the lower quadrants. Bowel sounds are absent. His parents report no significant past medical history but note that he has had poor appetite and weight loss over the past month.

            "concept": "The diagnostic criteria and time-phase diagnostic algorithm for typhoid fever in children involve a systematic approach to identifying core clinical features, differentiating key conditions, and utilizing definitive tests with appropriate interpretation. Core clinical features typically include high-grade fever persisting for more than five days, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and nonspecific symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, and headache. In immunocompromised pediatric patients, presentations may be more severe, with profound bacteremia, rapid progression to septic shock, and complications like intestinal perforation, encephalopathy, meningitis, or osteomyelitis. These children often exhibit delayed bacterial clearance due to impaired cell-mediated immunity, necessitating aggressive and individualized management. Key differentials for typhoid fever include other febrile illnesses such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, and bacterial infections like tuberculosis or brucellosis. Differentiation relies on clinical suspicion and laboratory confirmation. Definitive testing involves blood cultures, which remain the gold standard for diagnosis, with sensitivity ranging from 40% to 80% and specificity near 100%. Blood cultures should ideally be obtained before antibiotic initiation and repeated after 72 hours, continuing weekly until negative in immunocompromised patients. Stool and urine cultures may provide additional diagnostic support but are less sensitive. Imaging studies, such as abdominal ultrasound, are recommended for detecting complications like abscesses or perforation, particularly in atypical presentations. Sampling pitfalls include inadequate blood volume for culture, which reduces diagnostic yield, and delays in sample processing. Interpretation of results requires careful consideration of timing; cultures obtained after antibiotic initiation may yield false negatives. Clinicians should avoid over-reliance on serological tests due to limited sensitivity and specificity. In areas with high fluoroquinolone resistance, these drugs should be avoided in children unless other options fail, with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin considered only under strict indications. Notably, vaccination plays a preventive role, with Typhoid Conjugate Vaccines (TCVs) and Vi polysaccharide vaccines recommended for children aged ≥2 years. In immunocompromised patients, live oral Ty21a vaccines are contraindicated, and vaccines should be administered during stable periods to optimize antibody response.",

Over the past two days, he has developed intermittent abdominal pain and mild headaches. His family reports no recent travel or known sick contacts. On examination, he appears tired but is alert. His temperature is 39.5°C, pulse rate 110/min, and blood pressure 90/60 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals mild distension, generalized tenderness, and hepatosplenomegaly. No rash or lymphadenopathy is noted. A rapid malaria test is negative, and a complete blood count shows leukopenia (WBC 3,800/mm³) with a relative neutrophilia. Blood culture has been sent, but results are pending. The child was started on oral antibiotics three days ago at a local clinic, with no significant improvement in symptoms.",

These\nchildren  often present with highngrade fever, profound bacteremia and rapid progression to\nseptic shock[27]. Their impaired cellnmediated immunity results in higher bacterial loads and\ndelays in clearing  Salmonella from intracellular niches. Consequently, management must be\naggressive and  individualized. Early hospital admission and prompt initiation of parenteral\nantibiotics are essential. Thirdngeneration cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day\nintravenously in one or two  divided doses) or cefotaxime (100–200 mg/kg/day) are preferred\nfirstnline agents because they  achieve high serum levels and cover multidrugnresistant\nstrains. For suspected extensively  drugnresistant infections, carbapenems (imipenem or\nmeropenem) combined with azithromycin may  be required; local susceptibility data should guide\ntherapy. Treatment duration should be longer than  in immunocompetent patients—at least 14 days\nof effective antibiotics and continuing for seven days  after defervescence to reduce relapse\nrisk[1]. Blood cultures should be repeated after 72 hours and  weekly thereafter until\nnegative. Supportive care includes intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte  imbalances,\nand monitoring for complications such as intestinal perforation, encephalopathy,  meningitis or\nosteomyelitis. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 3 mg/kg in a single intravenous dose  followed by\n1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 48 hours) may reduce mortality in severe typhoid  encephalopathy but\nshould be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients due to further  immunosuppression. Because immunocompromised children may have atypical presentations or prolonged bacteremia,\nclinicians should maintain a low threshold for imaging studies (e.g., abdominal ultrasound to\ndetect  abscesses or perforation) and consult infectious disease specialists.

Her parents report that she has been lethargic and has developed loose stools over the past two days. She was started on oral antibiotics three days ago by a local practitioner but remains febrile. On examination, she is febrile (39.5°C), tachycardic (HR 120 bpm), and appears dehydrated. Her abdomen is mildly distended with tenderness in the right lower quadrant but no rebound tenderness. A rapid Widal test performed at the clinic shows elevated titers for Salmonella typhi 'O' and 'H' antigens. Blood cultures are pending. The treating physician is concerned about her lack of response to initial therapy and the reliability of serologic testing in this setting.",

            "sequence_no": 6,
            "concept": "Differentiating typhoid fever from other febrile illnesses in children is critical due to overlapping clinical presentations with conditions such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, and viral hepatitis. Typhoid fever typically presents with a stepwise fever pattern, relative bradycardia, abdominal discomfort, and a toxic appearance. In contrast, dengue is characterized by an abrupt onset of high-grade fever, myalgias, retro-orbital pain, and thrombocytopenia. Malaria often features cyclical fevers and can be confirmed by the presence of parasitaemia on a peripheral smear. Leptospirosis may present with conjunctival suffusion and jaundice, while hepatitis A or E is more likely to cause marked jaundice and significantly elevated transaminases, which are less common in typhoid fever. Laboratory investigations are essential for differentiation. Blood cultures remain the gold standard for diagnosing typhoid fever, though their sensitivity may be limited by prior antibiotic use. Elevated Widal titers can support the diagnosis, but the test has limitations due to cross-reactivity and the presence of baseline antibodies in endemic regions, which can reduce specificity. In areas where malaria and dengue are endemic, rapid diagnostic tests for these illnesses should be routinely performed in febrile children. Persistent fever despite appropriate therapy should prompt consideration of co-infections, particularly in endemic settings. From a practical standpoint, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for typhoid fever in children presenting with prolonged fever and systemic signs, especially in endemic regions. A thorough clinical history, including exposure risks, and a focused physical examination can help narrow the differential diagnosis. Early and appropriate laboratory testing, including blood cultures and rapid diagnostics for other febrile illnesses, is crucial for guiding management. Recognizing the characteristic clinical features and integrating laboratory findings can aid in distinguishing typhoid fever from other febrile illnesses, ensuring timely and targeted treatment.",

There is no history of rash, bleeding, or joint pain. On examination, he appears lethargic and toxic. His temperature is 102.4°F, pulse is 78/min (relative bradycardia), and blood pressure is normal. Abdominal examination reveals mild distension, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and hepatomegaly. There is no jaundice, conjunctival suffusion, or lymphadenopathy. A rapid diagnostic test for malaria is negative, and his platelet count is 160,000/μL. Blood cultures have been sent, but results are pending.",

            "sequence_no": 7,
            "concept": "The first-line antimicrobial therapy for paediatric typhoid fever depends on the severity of the disease and the sensitivity of the causative organism. For uncomplicated typhoid managed in an outpatient setting, cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, is the first-line treatment at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for 14 days in cases of fully sensitive typhoid. If multidrug-resistant (MDR) typhoid is suspected, azithromycin at 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days is recommended as the second-line option. For severe typhoid requiring hospitalization, particularly in children unable to tolerate oral medications, the first-line therapy involves intravenous ceftriaxone at 75 mg/kg/day or cefotaxime at 150–200 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Once clinical improvement is observed, a switch to oral cefixime is advised. In cases of MDR typhoid with severe presentations, second-line options include aztreonam or meropenem, which are reserved for resistant cases. The decision to manage paediatric typhoid fever as an inpatient or outpatient is guided by specific clinical criteria. Hospitalization is warranted in the presence of persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea, abdominal distension, toxemia, or complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. Younger infants and toddlers are admitted due to the risk of rapid disease progression and challenges in supervising oral therapy. Additional indications for inpatient care include organ dysfunction, shock, respiratory distress, massive third spacing, severe thrombocytopenia, altered mental status (e.g., delirium or encephalopathy), or inability to tolerate oral medications. Infants under 28 days, children with severe dehydration, prolonged seizures, altered sensorium, or oxygen saturation below 90% also require admission. Social factors, such as unreliable caregivers, poor sanitation at home, or inability to ensure follow-up, further support hospitalization. Complications like typhoid intestinal perforation, intestinal haemorrhage, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, and encephalopathy necessitate inpatient management, often with surgical consultation. The WHO recommends close monitoring for severe complications, including convulsions, coma, shock, and severe dehydration, with nursing assessments every three hours and physician reviews twice daily. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, such as sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, require immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and urgent surgical intervention.",

His parents report that he has had poor oral intake, intermittent vomiting, and loose stools over the past 3 days. On examination, he appears lethargic and mildly dehydrated. His abdomen is distended with tenderness in the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rigidity. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 39.5°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Laboratory investigations show leukopenia and a Widal test positive for Salmonella typhi. Despite starting oral cefixime 3 days ago at another clinic, his fever persists, and his symptoms have worsened.",

            "concept": "Supportive care is a cornerstone in the management of typhoid fever in children, focusing on hydration, fever management, and nutritional considerations to stabilize the patient and promote recovery. Adequate hydration is critical to prevent dehydration, particularly in the presence of vomiting or diarrhea. Oral rehydration is preferred when feasible, but intravenous fluids should be administered if oral intake is insufficient or contraindicated. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance is essential to counteract the systemic toxicity associated with typhoid fever. Fever management involves the judicious use of antipyretics to provide symptomatic relief; however, clinicians must exercise caution to avoid masking signs of severe complications, such as intestinal perforation. Nutritional support is equally important, as children with typhoid fever often experience a loss of appetite and generalized weakness. Ensuring adequate caloric and nutrient intake supports the body’s energy requirements during recovery. The overarching goal of supportive care is to optimize the child’s physiological status, enabling them to better tolerate the systemic effects of typhoid fever and its potential complications. Practical bedside decision-making involves regular monitoring of hydration status through clinical signs such as mucous membrane moisture, skin turgor, and urine output. Fever should be managed with antipyretics like acetaminophen, while avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to their potential gastrointestinal side effects. Nutritional interventions should be tailored to the child’s tolerance, starting with easily digestible, nutrient-dense foods and advancing as tolerated. Not specified in the source are precise thresholds for fluid administration rates, specific antipyretic dosing, or detailed nutritional protocols. However, the emphasis remains on individualized care to address the child’s hydration, fever, and nutritional needs effectively.",

            "concept": "Management of treatment failure and escalation protocols in pediatric typhoid fever require careful assessment and intervention based on clinical severity and complications. Admission criteria include persistent vomiting, severe diarrhea, abdominal distension, toxemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or perforation. Infants under 28 days, younger toddlers, and children with severe dehydration, prolonged seizures, altered sensorium, inability to maintain oral intake, or oxygen saturation <90% should also be hospitalized. Additional indications for admission include organ dysfunction, shock, respiratory distress, massive third spacing, severe thrombocytopenia, mental status changes (delirium or encephalopathy), and unreliable caregivers or poor sanitation at home. Complications such as typhoid intestinal perforation, intestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, and encephalopathy necessitate inpatient care, often with surgical consultation. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, including sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, require immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and urgent surgical attention. For multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) infections, hospitalization is essential, with intravenous ceftriaxone (75–100 mg/kg/day, maximum 4 g/day) as the first-line agent, or cefotaxime (150–200 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) as an alternative for biliary sludging or cholestasis. Treatment duration should be at least 14 days or seven days after defervescence. Children failing oral therapy due to high local resistance rates (>90% for fluoroquinolones) should be switched to parenteral therapy. Monitoring for side effects of high-dose azithromycin, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems is critical in XDR cases. Initial laboratory investigations for treatment failure are not specified in the source. Stabilization steps include fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (20 mL/kg repeated as needed), nasogastric decompression, and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. Thresholds for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission are not specified in the source. Discharge and review triggers include resolution of complications and completion of antibiotic therapy, but specific criteria are not detailed in the source.",

            "concept": "Recognition and management of severe complications in typhoid fever, particularly typhoid intestinal perforation, require a structured approach. Early complications include persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea, abdominal distension, toxemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and perforation. Late complications, such as typhoid intestinal perforation, typically occur around two weeks after symptom onset due to necrosis of Peyer’s patches leading to ileal perforation. Clinical features of perforation include persistent high fever, new-onset severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, guarding, and signs of peritonitis. Imaging may reveal free air under the diaphragm on plain abdominal radiographs or free fluid on ultrasound. Red-flag warning signs necessitating urgent intervention include sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock. These signs mandate immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and surgical consultation. The pathophysiology of typhoid perforation involves Salmonella-induced necrosis of intestinal lymphoid tissue, leading to structural compromise and perforation. Bedside monitoring of children with typhoid fever complications should include close observation for signs of shock, respiratory distress, altered sensorium, massive third spacing, thrombocytopenia, or oxygen saturation below 90%. The WHO Pocket Book recommends nurse monitoring every three hours and physician review twice daily for children with complications such as gastrointestinal perforation, encephalopathy, severe dehydration, or cardiac failure. Escalation of care is essential if any of these findings are present. Definitive management of typhoid intestinal perforation begins with fluid resuscitation using isotonic crystalloids at 20 mL/kg, repeated as needed, and nasogastric decompression. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting Salmonella and anaerobes are critical, with regimens including ceftriaxone 50–75 mg/kg/day (maximum 4 g/day) plus metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg (maximum 500 mg) every 8 hours or ciprofloxacin 10 mg/kg (maximum 400 mg) plus metronidazole. Surgery involves closure of the perforation, resection with anastomosis, or ileostomy depending on the perforation size and child’s condition. Postoperative intensive care focuses on managing sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, and nutritional support. Follow-up care includes continuation of antibiotics for at least 14 days or seven days post-defervescence, monitoring for multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant strains, and addressing social factors such as poor sanitation or unreliable caregivers.",

            "sequence_no": 12,
            "concept": "In paediatric patients, imaging is generally unnecessary for uncomplicated typhoid fever but becomes crucial when complications such as intestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatobiliary involvement, or abscess formation are suspected. Early complications like intestinal perforation often occur around two weeks after symptom onset due to necrosis of Peyer’s patches, leading to ileal perforation. Late complications may include hepatobiliary issues such as acute acalculous cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, or splenic abscesses. Initial imaging for suspected perforation includes upright chest or abdominal radiographs, which detect free air under the diaphragm in approximately 75% of cases. Ultrasonography is widely available and serves as the first-line modality, identifying free fluid, thickened ileal loops, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and gallbladder wall thickening, with an 85.7% sensitivity for detecting peritoneal collections in perforation cases. Cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), is reserved for persistent clinical signs despite therapy or atypical complications. CT can reveal concentric mural thickening of the terminal ileum, colitis, mesenteric adenopathy, ascites, and localise sites of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. It is also effective in detecting hepatobiliary complications and splenic abscesses or rupture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is primarily used for suspected liver abscesses or osteomyelitis when CT findings are inconclusive or when radiation exposure is a concern. Red-flag warning signs necessitating imaging include abdominal distension, persistent vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, or altered mental status. The pathophysiology underlying these complications involves bacterial invasion and necrosis of lymphoid tissue, leading to perforation, haemorrhage, or abscess formation. Bedside monitoring should focus on signs of peritonitis, sepsis, and haemodynamic instability. In resource-limited settings, ultrasound combined with plain radiographs can provide valuable diagnostic information when CT is unavailable, but the absence of imaging should not delay referral if complications like perforation, haemorrhage, or encephalopathy are suspected. Definitive management involves prompt fluid resuscitation, nasogastric decompression, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and, in cases of perforation, surgical intervention such as closure, resection with anastomosis, or ileostomy. Postoperative care includes intensive monitoring for sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, and nutritional support. Follow-up imaging may be required to assess recovery or detect residual complications.",

            "concept": "Special considerations for immunocompromised and malnourished children with typhoid fever include a heightened risk of severe disease and complications due to their vulnerable health status. Immunocompromised children, such as those with HIV or severe malnutrition, are particularly susceptible to rapid disease progression and complications like septic shock, encephalopathy, and dehydration. Malnourished children often face additional challenges, such as impaired immune responses and difficulty maintaining adequate hydration and electrolyte balance. In these groups, blood culture yields may be lower due to smaller sample volumes, but at least 1–3 mL of blood should be drawn when feasible to improve diagnostic accuracy. Vaccination with the typhoid conjugate vaccine is recommended from six months of age to provide protection to this high-risk population. Hospitalization is often necessary for immunocompromised and malnourished children due to their increased vulnerability and the challenges of managing the disease in outpatient settings. Social factors, such as crowded living conditions, limited access to safe water, and poor sanitation, further complicate home-based care. Inpatient care ensures strict infection control, adherence to treatment, and the provision of health education to caregivers. Antibiotic therapy must be carefully tailored to the child’s weight, with ceftriaxone at 75–100 mg/kg/day (maximum 4 g/day) as the first-line agent for hospitalized patients in India, and cefotaxime at 150–200 mg/kg/day in three divided doses as an alternative when biliary sludging or cholestasis is a concern. Treatment duration should be at least 14 days or seven days after defervescence. For children with multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) infections, hospitalization allows for the administration of high-dose azithromycin, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems, as well as monitoring for potential side effects. Discharge criteria for these children include being afebrile for at least 48 hours, tolerating oral feeds, and having stable vital signs. Not specified in the source are additional considerations for catch-up vaccination schedules or specific contraindications for immunocompromised and malnourished children.",

His weight-for-height z-score is below -3, and he has generalized muscle wasting. His temperature is 39.5°C, heart rate is 130 bpm, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals diffuse tenderness and mild distension without guarding. Despite being on oral antibiotics prescribed at a local clinic for three days, his fever persists.

            "concept": "Antimicrobial resistance trends significantly impact the management of pediatric typhoid fever, necessitating careful consideration of antibiotic choices. Resistance to fluoroquinolones, once a cornerstone of typhoid treatment, has emerged as a major challenge, particularly in regions with high prevalence of Nalidixic Acid-positive strains. While fluoroquinolones demonstrate high tissue penetration and lower relapse rates, their use in children is increasingly debated due to concerns about treatment failure and the potential for further resistance induction. Cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, and azithromycin are now favored by many clinicians, although azithromycin's safety and efficacy in pediatric populations remain under scrutiny, especially with emerging resistance patterns. The decision between monotherapy and combination therapy is another critical consideration. Some guidelines recommend initiating combination therapy in severe cases or adding a second drug if no clinical improvement is observed within 2–3 days. Historical antibiotics like chloramphenicol, once widely used for typhoid treatment, are being reconsidered due to their ability to reduce the carrier state; however, concerns about severe side effects, including aplastic anemia, limit their widespread reintroduction. For bedside decision-making, pediatricians must assess local resistance patterns and weigh the risks and benefits of available antibiotics. Empirical therapy should be guided by sensitivity testing whenever possible, avoiding fluoroquinolones in cases of documented resistance. Cephalosporins and azithromycin are preferred options, with careful monitoring for clinical improvement. In severe or complicated cases, combination therapy may be warranted early to prevent progression to complications such as typhoid intestinal perforation. Chloramphenicol should only be considered in specific scenarios where its benefits outweigh the risks. Ultimately, antimicrobial stewardship is crucial to mitigate resistance development and ensure effective management of pediatric typhoid fever. Not specified in the source are precise sensitivity/specificity values, dose thresholds, or timing windows for resistance testing in pediatric populations.",

            "concept": "Public health measures to reduce typhoid transmission among household contacts and at the community level require a comprehensive approach encompassing screening, vaccination, hygiene, sanitation, and outbreak reporting. Screening for typhoid in household contacts focuses on symptomatic individuals, as prophylactic antibiotics are generally not recommended. Chronic carriers, particularly food handlers, pose a significant risk, as illustrated by the West Bengal outbreak where contamination was traced to a sweet shop worker. Screening food handlers for chronic carriage is challenging, but those with a history of infection should be treated and counseled on hygiene practices to minimize transmission risks. \n\nVaccination is a cornerstone of community-level typhoid control. The World Health Organization recommends the introduction of the typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic regions, emphasizing its role as a complement to water and sanitation improvements. In India, TCV is being rolled out through the Universal Immunisation Programme, targeting children at nine months of age and high-risk populations. Mass vaccination campaigns, such as those in Navi Mumbai, have demonstrated that high coverage significantly reduces disease incidence and transmission. School-based vaccination for older children and booster doses may be considered in high-burden areas. Public health authorities should integrate typhoid vaccination with other immunization activities, maintain surveillance to monitor vaccine effectiveness, and detect outbreaks promptly.\n\nSanitation and food/water hygiene are critical for reducing typhoid transmission. Access to safe drinking water is essential, with communities encouraged to use protected wells or piped supplies that are regularly chlorinated and maintained. Point-of-use water treatment, such as boiling or chlorination, is recommended when centralized water safety cannot be ensured. Behavioral interventions like hand washing with soap, safe food preparation, and proper waste disposal are effective and feasible in low-resource settings. Food handlers in restaurants, school canteens, and street food vendors should be trained and monitored to ensure compliance with hygiene regulations. Schools and childcare centers must provide safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities to prevent transmission among children.\n\nCommunity engagement is vital for sustainable prevention. Authorities should collaborate with local leaders and health workers to promote awareness of typhoid symptoms, encourage early care-seeking, and dispel myths about vaccination. Outbreak reporting and investigation, as demonstrated in the West Bengal case, are essential for identifying vulnerabilities and implementing targeted interventions.",

On examination, the child is febrile (39.2°C), appears lethargic, and has mild abdominal tenderness without guarding. A complete blood count reveals leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. The family mentions they rely on an untreated well for drinking water, and the boy's school does not have access to clean sanitation facilities. The child’s younger sibling, aged 6, has started showing similar symptoms. The community has not received typhoid vaccination campaigns, and sanitation infrastructure is poor.",

            "sequence_no": 16,
            "concept": "Return-to-school criteria following typhoid fever in children must balance the child’s health with public health considerations. Guidelines from various health departments provide a framework, though specific recommendations may vary. The Washington Department of Health advises that children may return to school or daycare after clinical recovery only if they produce three consecutive negative stool cultures collected 24 hours apart, with the first sample taken at least 48 hours after completing antibiotic therapy. Older children may return earlier if excluded from food handling and strict hygiene is maintained. The Kansas Department of Health specifies that stool cultures should be collected no sooner than 48 hours after the last antibiotic dose and at least one month after illness onset. If any culture is positive, additional monthly cultures are required until three consecutive negative results are documented. During this period, children cannot return to high-risk settings. Similarly, the Texas Department of State Health Services recommends three negative stool cultures taken 24 hours apart before school re-entry. In resource-limited settings like India, where repeated cultures may be impractical, return to school is generally permitted 1–2 weeks after completing therapy if the child is afebrile, has normal bowel habits, and can maintain strict hand hygiene. The child should not prepare food for others and must have access to clean water and functional toilets at school. Teachers should be informed of the child’s recent illness, and some schools may require a doctor’s certificate confirming recovery. For households with immunocompromised members or infants, stool cultures should be negative before school re-entry, as convalescent carriers may shed bacteria intermittently for months. If stool cultures remain positive, the child should be referred for specialist evaluation, which may include prolonged antibiotic therapy or cholecystectomy. Counselling parents on treatment adherence is critical to prevent relapse and chronic carriage. Parents should ensure the full course of antibiotics is completed, as premature discontinuation increases relapse risk. Follow-up visits are recommended 3–5 days after starting therapy to assess clinical response and at the end of treatment to evaluate for residual symptoms. Monthly follow-ups are advised for up to 70 days post-therapy, as relapses occur in 5–10% of children, typically 1–3 weeks after treatment but occasionally later. Monitoring for complications and adherence to local public health guidelines is essential.",

After completing antibiotic therapy, a clinical review should be conducted one week post-treatment to assess defervescence, weight gain, and appetite. Stool cultures may be obtained during this visit and repeated at four weeks to exclude chronic carriage, which occurs in approximately one to four percent of cases. Families should be educated to seek immediate medical attention if fever or abdominal pain recurs, as relapse typically occurs one to three weeks after recovery. In immunocompromised children or those with complications, follow-up should be extended to monthly reviews for three months to monitor growth and cognitive development. Not specified in source regarding differentiation between relapse and reinfection. Counselling families is critical to ensure they understand the importance of follow-up visits, adherence to prescribed treatment, and recognizing warning signs of recurrence or complications. Families should be informed about the risk of chronic carriage and the need for stool testing at specified intervals. Additionally, they should be advised on the importance of hygiene practices to prevent reinfection and transmission to others. For immunocompromised children, counselling should include discussions about the heightened risk of complications and the necessity of prolonged follow-up care. Not specified in source regarding additional counselling measures for symptom resolution or reinfection prevention.",

His initial symptoms included high-grade fever, abdominal pain, and poor appetite. At this visit, his mother reports that his appetite has improved, and he has gained some energy, but he has had intermittent low-grade fever over the past two days. He also complains of mild abdominal discomfort. On examination, he appears well-nourished, but his temperature is 99.8°F. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant without guarding or rebound tenderness. Stool cultures were sent during his initial treatment but results are not available yet. His family is concerned about recurrence and asks whether he might need additional treatment or tests.",

            "sequence_no": 18,
            "concept": "In India, the typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) known as Typbar-TCV is licensed for use and recommended by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP). The vaccine uses tetanus toxoid as a carrier protein and achieves over 90% seroconversion in pediatric and adult groups. According to the WHO’s 2018 position, a single 0.5 ml dose is recommended for children aged 6 months to 45 years in endemic areas. Routine programmatic vaccination is advised either at 9 months of age or during the second year of life. Catch-up vaccination is critical for children up to 15 years of age if they missed earlier doses. Revaccination requirements remain unclear, with ongoing studies to determine its necessity. The vaccine is cost-effective, as it reduces healthcare expenses, productivity losses, and the risk of long-term complications associated with typhoid. Specific target groups include household contacts of typhoid carriers, food handlers, healthcare workers, and travelers to endemic regions. The efficacy of TCVs is high, with significant seroconversion rates, but data on long-term waning immunity is not specified in the source. Contraindications include live oral Ty21a vaccines for immunocompromised children due to the risk of systemic infection. In such cases, intramuscular Vi polysaccharide vaccines (single dose for children aged 2 years and above, with boosters every 3 years) or TCVs are preferred. These vaccines are considered safe in immunocompromised individuals, although antibody responses may be reduced. Vaccination should be administered when the child’s condition is stable and not during acute illness. Catch-up vaccination is emphasized for children up to 15 years of age, and special groups such as household contacts of immunocompromised children should also be vaccinated. For these contacts, the Ty21a vaccine is safe as it has no documented secondary transmission. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended; instead, preventive measures should focus on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices and safe food handling.",

However, over the last 24 hours, he developed severe, continuous abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and vomiting. On examination, he appears lethargic and dehydrated, with a temperature of 39.4°C, heart rate of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. His abdomen is distended with marked tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are absent. Plain abdominal radiograph reveals free air under the diaphragm.

His parents report that he had initially been treated with oral antibiotics at a local clinic but his symptoms worsened despite therapy. On examination, he is febrile (39.5°C), tachycardic (HR 120 bpm), and appears lethargic. His abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant. Bowel sounds are absent. A plain abdominal X-ray shows free air under the diaphragm. His family reports difficulty accessing healthcare due to financial constraints and long travel distances.

            "concept": "Prophylactic measures for high-risk pediatric populations aim to prevent severe complications and optimize outcomes in children predisposed to typhoid fever and its associated risks. Hospitalization criteria are crucial for identifying children who require intensive monitoring and management. Persistent vomiting, severe diarrhea, abdominal distension, toxemia, or complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation are strong indications for inpatient care. Infants under 28 days, younger toddlers, and children with rapid disease progression or difficulty in supervising oral therapy should also be admitted. Additional clinical signs necessitating hospitalization include organ dysfunction, shock, respiratory distress, massive third spacing, severe thrombocytopenia, mental status changes (e.g., delirium or encephalopathy), inability to maintain oral intake, or oxygen saturation below 90%. Social factors, such as unreliable caregivers, poor sanitation, crowded households, or lack of access to safe water, further support admission. Immunocompromised children, including those with HIV or severe malnutrition, are particularly vulnerable and require close monitoring. For children with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid infections, hospitalization enables the administration of appropriate parenteral therapy and monitoring for side effects. Intravenous ceftriaxone (75–100 mg/kg/day, maximum 4 g/day) is the first-line treatment in India, with cefotaxime (150–200 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) as an alternative in cases of biliary sludging or cholestasis. Treatment duration is recommended for at least 14 days or seven days after defervescence. If local fluoroquinolone resistance rates exceed 90%, children initially treated with oral antibiotics who fail to improve should be admitted and switched to parenteral therapy. Hospitalization also facilitates management of complications such as typhoid intestinal perforation, which requires urgent intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic organisms, and surgical intervention. Signs of perforation, including sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, demand immediate action. Practical bedside decision-making should prioritize early recognition of high-risk features, prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, and close monitoring to prevent progression to life-threatening complications.",

            "concept": "When monitoring carrier status post-typhoid fever in children, stool cultures play a critical role in determining when it is safe for them to return to school or daycare. Clinicians should suspect ongoing bacterial carriage in children who have clinically recovered but may still shed Salmonella Typhi intermittently. Public health guidelines, such as those from the Washington Department of Health, recommend that children may return to school only after producing three consecutive negative stool cultures collected 24 hours apart, with the first sample taken at least 48 hours after completing antibiotic therapy. Similarly, the Kansas Department of Health specifies that the first stool sample should be collected no sooner than 48 hours after the last antibiotic dose and at least one month after illness onset. If any culture is positive, additional cultures should be performed at monthly intervals until three consecutive negative results are obtained. During this period, children should not return to high-risk settings, such as daycare or food handling environments. The Texas Department of State Health Services also advises three negative stool cultures taken at least 24 hours apart before school re-entry. These principles are broadly applicable, though resource constraints in some Indian settings may limit repeated testing. For stool culture schedules and clearance criteria, at least two to three negative stool specimens collected 24 hours apart and 48 hours after completing antibiotics are recommended when laboratory facilities are available. If stool cultures remain positive after repeated testing, the child should be referred for specialist evaluation, which may include prolonged antibiotic therapy or cholecystectomy. Household and school precautions include ensuring scrupulous hand hygiene, safe disposal of stools, and the use of separate eating utensils. Children should avoid preparing food for others and must have access to clean water and functional toilets. Teachers should be informed of the child’s recent illness, and some schools may require a doctor’s certificate before re-admission. For households with immunocompromised members or infants, school re-entry may be delayed until stool cultures are confirmed negative. Public health reporting guidelines were not specified in the source.",

His initial illness was marked by high-grade fever, abdominal pain, and fatigue, and he had been hospitalized for 5 days. He has since recovered clinically and is afebrile, eating well, and gaining strength. His parents are eager for him to return to school. However, the local health worker notes that his school requires clearance to ensure he is no longer shedding Salmonella Typhi.

            "sequence_no": 24,
            "concept": "The role of serologic tests in diagnosing typhoid fever and differentiating it from other febrile illnesses in children is both significant and limited. Clinically, typhoid fever often presents with stepwise fever, relative bradycardia, abdominal discomfort, and a toxic appearance. These features help distinguish it from other febrile illnesses such as dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and viral hepatitis. Dengue typically manifests with abrupt high-grade fever, myalgias, retro-orbital pain, and thrombocytopenia. Malaria is characterized by cyclical fevers and parasitaemia on smear, while leptospirosis may present with conjunctival suffusion and jaundice. Hepatitis A or E is notable for marked jaundice and elevated transaminases, which are less common in typhoid fever. Laboratory tests play a crucial role in differentiation. Blood cultures are the gold standard for typhoid diagnosis, and elevated Widal titers may support the diagnosis. However, the Widal test has significant limitations due to cross-reactivity with other infections and the presence of baseline antibodies in endemic regions, making its interpretation challenging. Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and dengue are recommended in febrile children from endemic areas, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for co-infections, especially if fever persists despite appropriate therapy. Sampling pitfalls include the potential for false-negative blood cultures due to prior antibiotic use or low bacterial loads, emphasizing the importance of timely sample collection before antibiotic initiation. When interpreting serologic tests, clinicians should avoid over-reliance on Widal titers alone and consider clinical context and other laboratory findings. Repeated blood cultures may be necessary in cases of persistent or atypical presentations. Not specified in the source are the precise sensitivity and specificity values of the Widal test or other serologic assays. Clinicians must remain cautious about the limitations of serologic tests and utilize a comprehensive diagnostic approach, combining clinical features, laboratory findings, and epidemiological context, to differentiate typhoid fever from other febrile illnesses in children effectively.",

            "sequence_no": 25,
            "concept": "In India, typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) are licensed and have been integrated into the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). The current schedule targets children at nine months of age, with additional focus on high-risk populations. Mass vaccination campaigns, such as those conducted by the Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine Introduction Project in Navi Mumbai, have demonstrated that achieving high coverage can significantly reduce disease incidence and transmission. In high-burden areas, school-based vaccination of older children and booster doses may be considered to enhance protection. Public health authorities are encouraged to integrate typhoid vaccination with other immunisation activities to maximise uptake and maintain surveillance for monitoring vaccine effectiveness and detecting outbreaks. The efficacy of TCVs in endemic areas has been well-documented, with high coverage leading to marked reductions in disease incidence and transmission. However, the source does not specify the duration of immunity or the extent of waning over time. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that vaccination should complement water and sanitation improvements, as these remain foundational to long-term typhoid control. Contraindications for TCVs are not specified in the source. However, it is implied that vaccination should be part of a broader strategy that includes addressing environmental and behavioural determinants of typhoid transmission. For catch-up vaccination and special groups, the source highlights the importance of targeting high-risk populations, though specific catch-up schedules are not detailed. It also suggests that schools and childcare centres should prioritise safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities to prevent transmission among children. Screening of food handlers for chronic carriage is noted as challenging, but individuals with a history of infection should be treated and counselled on hygiene practices. Public health campaigns should emphasise hand hygiene, safe food preparation, and proper waste disposal as immediate, low-cost interventions. Community engagement, including collaboration with local leaders and health workers, is critical for promoting vaccination awareness, encouraging early care-seeking, and dispelling myths. Prophylactic antibiotics for household contacts are generally not recommended.",

            "sequence_no": 26,
            "concept": "To ensure public health safety and manage the risk of typhoid fever transmission, specific measures are recommended for monitoring carrier status and managing household contacts, particularly in paediatric cases. Clinicians should suspect carriage in children recovering from typhoid fever who continue to shed Salmonella Typhi in their stools, as convalescent carriers can intermittently excrete bacteria for months. Stool cultures play a critical role in monitoring carrier status post-illness. Guidelines from various public health authorities recommend obtaining at least three consecutive negative stool cultures collected 24 hours apart, with the first sample taken no sooner than 48 hours after completing antibiotic therapy. The Kansas Department of Health specifies that the first culture should also be collected at least one month after illness onset. If any stool culture is positive, additional cultures should be performed at monthly intervals until three consecutive negative results are documented. These criteria are particularly important for children in high-risk settings, such as daycare facilities or those involved in food handling.\n\nHousehold and school precautions are essential to prevent transmission. Children should remain at home until they are afebrile, their appetite has returned, and their stools are formed. In resource-limited settings where repeated stool cultures may not be feasible, clinicians may allow return to school one to two weeks after completing therapy, provided the child adheres to strict hand hygiene, avoids food preparation, and has access to functional toilets and clean water. For households with immunocompromised members or infants, school return may be delayed until stool cultures confirm clearance. Safe disposal of stools and the use of separate eating utensils are recommended. Teachers and caregivers should be informed of the child’s recent illness to ensure vigilance.\n\nPublic health reporting is crucial for managing community-level outbreaks. Clinicians should follow local public health authority guidelines and provide parents with clear, written instructions. Persistent stool culture positivity warrants specialist evaluation, which may include prolonged antibiotic therapy or cholecystectomy. Not specified in the source are broader community-level outbreak management strategies.",

            "concept": "In the context of treatment failure, escalation, or rescue in paediatric typhoid fever, specific criteria guide admission, escalation to intensive care, and eventual discharge. Hospitalization is warranted in children presenting with persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea, abdominal distension, toxemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or perforation. Younger infants and toddlers, due to rapid disease progression and challenges in supervising oral therapy, also require admission. Additional indications include severe dehydration, inability to maintain oral intake, oxygen saturation <90%, altered mental status (delirium or encephalopathy), shock, respiratory distress, massive third spacing, severe thrombocytopenia, or organ dysfunction. Social factors such as unreliable caregivers, poor sanitation at home, or inadequate follow-up capacity further necessitate inpatient care. Complications like intestinal perforation, intestinal haemorrhage, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, encephalopathy, convulsions, coma, or severe anaemia require close monitoring with nursing checks every three hours and physician reviews twice daily. Signs of gastrointestinal perforation, including sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, demand immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, resuscitation, and urgent surgical intervention. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic organisms are essential in such cases, and oral fluids should be withheld. For children with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid, intravenous ceftriaxone (75–100 mg/kg/day, maximum 4 g/day) is the first-line treatment, with cefotaxime (150–200 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) as an alternative if biliary complications arise. Therapy should continue for at least 14 days or seven days post-defervescence. If fluoroquinolone resistance exceeds 90% locally, children failing oral therapy should be admitted and transitioned to parenteral antibiotics. In immunocompromised children, who are at higher risk of severe disease and complications, early admission and aggressive parenteral therapy with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg/day or cefotaxime 100–200 mg/kg/day) are critical. Discharge is appropriate when the child has been afebrile for at least 48 hours, is tolerating oral feeds, has stable vital signs, and caregivers are educated on hygiene, medication adherence, and relapse recognition. Thresholds for PICU admission and specific initial laboratory investigations were not specified in the source.",

            "concept": "Recognition and timely management of complications in paediatric typhoid fever, particularly intestinal perforation, is critical due to its life-threatening nature. Early complications such as typhoid intestinal perforation typically occur around two weeks after symptom onset, resulting from necrosis of Peyer’s patches and subsequent ileal perforation. Clinical signs include persistent high fever, new-onset severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, guarding, and signs of peritonitis. Imaging findings may reveal free air under the diaphragm on plain abdominal radiographs or free fluid on ultrasound. Late complications include gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, encephalopathy, and severe dehydration, all of which necessitate hospital admission and close monitoring. Red-flag warning signs include sudden severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, which indicate gastrointestinal perforation and require immediate intervention. The pathophysiology of typhoid intestinal perforation involves the progressive necrosis of lymphoid tissue in Peyer’s patches, leading to transmural bowel wall damage and perforation. This results in peritonitis, sepsis, and shock if untreated. Bedside monitoring in hospitalized children should include close observation for signs of deterioration such as shock, respiratory distress, altered mental status, or worsening abdominal findings. The WHO Pocket Book recommends nursing assessments every three hours and physician reviews twice daily for children with severe complications such as intestinal perforation, shock, or encephalopathy. Immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, and fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (20 mL/kg boluses, repeated as needed) are essential steps in stabilization. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic organisms are critical, with ceftriaxone (50–75 mg/kg/day, maximum 4 g) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg, maximum 500 mg, 8-hourly) or ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg, maximum 400 mg) plus metronidazole as recommended regimens. Definitive management of intestinal perforation involves urgent surgical intervention, which may include closure of the perforation, resection with anastomosis, or ileostomy creation based on the perforation size and the child’s condition. Postoperative care in the intensive care unit focuses on managing sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, and nutritional support. Follow-up care includes ensuring complete resolution of infection, monitoring for surgical complications, and addressing any underlying risk factors such as malnutrition or poor sanitation.",

            "sequence_no": 30,
            "concept": "In the context of paediatric typhoid fever, certain special populations require careful consideration for inpatient management due to their heightened vulnerability or clinical complexity. Hospitalization is essential for children presenting with persistent vomiting, severe diarrhoea, abdominal distension, toxemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or complications such as intestinal perforation. Younger infants and toddlers are particularly at risk due to the rapid progression of disease and challenges in supervising oral therapy. Additional indications for admission include organ dysfunction, shock, respiratory distress, massive third spacing, severe thrombocytopenia, mental status changes (e.g., delirium or encephalopathy), inability to tolerate oral medications, or oxygen saturation below 90%. Infants under 28 days, children with prolonged seizures or altered sensorium, and those with severe dehydration or persistent vomiting also warrant inpatient care, as per Indian Pediatric Task Force guidelines. Social factors, such as unreliable caregivers, poor home sanitation, or inability to return for follow-up, further justify hospital admission. Children with complications like typhoid intestinal perforation, intestinal haemorrhage, hepatitis, osteomyelitis, or encephalopathy require intensive inpatient management and often surgical consultation. For suspected gastrointestinal perforation, characterized by sudden severe abdominal pain, distension, guarding, pallor, and shock, immediate intravenous access, nasogastric decompression, fluid resuscitation, and urgent surgical intervention are critical. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeting gram-negative and anaerobic organisms are necessary, with ceftriaxone (75–100 mg/kg/day, maximum 4 g/day) as the first-line agent in India. Cefotaxime (150–200 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) is an alternative when biliary sludging or cholestasis is a concern. Antibiotic therapy should continue for at least 14 days or seven days after defervescence. Children with multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid infections also require inpatient care for parenteral therapy and monitoring for side effects of high-dose azithromycin, third-generation cephalosporins, or carbapenems. Social vulnerabilities, such as crowded living conditions, limited sanitation, or immunocompromised status (e.g., HIV or severe malnutrition), may further necessitate hospitalization to ensure adequate treatment and monitoring.",
